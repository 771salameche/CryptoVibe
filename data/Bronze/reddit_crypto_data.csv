3. The Treasury bonds begin earning interest to the tune of $60-80 million a year for WLFI.
4. This original $2B of USD1 is given to a shell company that 'invests' it back into Binance, which sits in Binance's bank account as USD1.
5. As long as Binance does not redeem the USD1 for cash, this will continue to earn money for WLFI.
6. Trump owns WLFI, so is getting $60-80 million a year for cash that was not his own.

May 2025 $2B investment was paid for in USD1.

Khanna criticized the pardon as corrupt, citing Zhao's financial ties to Trump's family crypto ventures. The bill aims to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure ethical conduct among public officials.

t3_1ol729g,"Trump Isn’t “Pro Crypto”... He’s Pro Trump...and his gang i know u people have probably heard it before but it is way clearer now than it was a year ago. A lot of what looks like “Trump loves crypto” lines up almost perfectly with stuff that benefits him... his family... or people close to him... not the average person holding BTC on a phone.

First... the public moves. He has been saying the U S should “support” digital assets... he has framed it as ending the old “war on crypto”... and he has tried to make it sound like America is open for on chain business again. All very loud... very pro innovation.

At the same time... reports this year said the Trump family’s own crypto and token ventures have pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars... in the same window when the administration was sounding the most crypto friendly. That overlap is hard to ignore. It looks less like “pro crypto” and more like “we made it friendlier while we were selling.”

Then there was the CZ pardon. Call it mercy if you want... but it was clearly a made-for-one-person decision. In the months leading up to it... Binance and CZ brought on Trump-aligned lobbyists... hired a D.C. firm close to his circle and spent serious money... and looped in a former SEC-adjacent lawyer who already had credibility with the new team. Several reports said the clemency push went through political channels... not the usual DOJ path. So this wasn’t “the administration helped crypto”... it was “a well connected crypto billionaire bought his way to the front of the line.”

Now add the tariff noise. Every time he rattles trade partners... Canada... Europe... whoever... it makes legacy markets nervous and pushes some attention back toward crypto... while his circle is the group most ready to sell... raise... and market in that environment. Convenient timing.

One more angle most people miss. The more this stuff turns into “policy for friends,” the messier your own taxes get because now you’re mixing airdrops, political tokens, pardoned-exec pump candles, prediction style gains etc. I’ve started tracking those flows separately in Awaken tax instead of just throwing it all under “capital gains,” because if the rules keep getting written by insiders I do not trust the IRS to be chill about how I label income later. That part is self defense not shill.

So yeah... he is not “pro crypto” the way CT means it. He is pro... his... crypto. Pro... his donors’... crypto. Pro... his friends’... crypto. Everyone else still has to buy tops and read press releases.",2025-10-31T21:39:48,r/cryptocurrency,hodorrny,2833,post

The same trader had previously been suspected of insider knowledge after profiting from well-timed Bitcoin and Ethereum shorts before Trump's tariff announcement. Speculation arose about insider trading, but some argue the pardon was predictable due to CZ's significant investments. Former BitForex CEO Garrett Jin denied involvement in the trades.

t1_noc4f3p,"I know correlation does not equal causation, but this really has me wondering: McDonald's uses the McRib as a tool to drive over all sales. It could always be available, but instead it is introduced sporadically in limited runs to boost sales in specific regions or to achieve some other goal that isn't simply: sell item for more than we paid for it.

What economic events trigger the decision to bring the McRib back?

# Pork Commodity Pricing Cycles

When pork prices drop, McDonald’s can lock in *extremely cheap bulk pork futures*.  
That makes the McRib **high-margin**, and they can suddenly “bring it back” as if by magic.

When pork prices are **low → McRib returns.**  
When pork prices are **high → McRib disappears.**

They’re literally arbitraging meat markets.

This is documented:  
The McRib tracks the Lean Hog Index.  
Not consumer taste.

# Q4 Earnings Pumping

The McRib almost always comes back in Q4, the quarter when:

\-companies report annual performance  
\-shareholders are watching  
\-bonuses are built on year-end performance targets

A limited-time hype item increases foot traffic across the board\*\*.\*\*

Not because everyone orders the McRib  
but because people come in to *look* at the McRib and buy fries.

So the McRib is a shareholder earnings lever

# Franchisee Morale + Participation Control

McDonald’s corporate needs *franchisees* to fall in line with menu transitions, equipment changes, and promotional cadence.

The McRib works as a compliance test.

When corporate says: ""We're doing the McRib again""

They can measure:

\-Which franchisees respond quickly  
\-Who follows operational directives smoothly  
\-Who needs pressure, rotation, or buyout

So McRib = management diagnostic tool.

# So how does this connect to Bitcoin?

The McRib tends to return when:

\-pork futures are cheap (indicates commodity downcycles)  
\-companies need Q4 performance boosts (liquidity injection season)  
\-consumer spending shifts (pre-holiday spending trends rising)

Bitcoin tends to rally when:

\-liquidity increases  
\-markets turn risk-on  
\-Q4 cycles favor speculation

So the McRib *accidentally* aligns with Bitcoin cycles…

**because they both respond to the same macroeconomic pressures.**",2025-11-11T19:58:26,r/cryptocurrency,twohundred37,53,comment

t1_nndy8u6,"tldr; A U.S. appeals court ruled against Michael Prime, who claimed the FBI illegally wiped a hard drive containing 3,443 Bitcoin worth $345 million. Prime had previously denied owning significant cryptocurrency and failed to claim the Bitcoin during asset recovery after his release from prison. The court deemed his delay in asserting ownership unreasonable and found his claims inconsistent. Judges stated awarding him the Bitcoin would be inequitable, even if it existed, as Prime's earlier disclosures contradicted his later claims.

t3_1oaxsiz,"trump announces tariffs. market crashes. then he says they're not sustainable and market starts gradually rising. trump family made $1b on crypto. what's going on here? oct 10: trump threatened 100% tariffs. markets panicked and about $16–19 billion in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated, wiping out many traders.

days later: he confirmed a meeting with xi and said the 100% tariff idea was “not sustainable,” effectively softening the policy stance that helped trigger the sell off.

meanwhile: the Financial Times reports the trump family has made roughly $1 billion in pre-tax profits from crypto ventures since the election. that reporting is the basis for the conflict of interest concerns.

the timing looks sus. whatis going on here?

political theater? scare china with a hard line, negotiate back. tariffs become leverage, not the end goal. traders get collateral damage. normal trade negotiation stuff.

policy testing? drop a shock to see market reaction, then calibrate strategy based on fallout. messy but plausible.

conflict of interest? if the family had holdings exposed, a crash and subsequent policy pivot could create trading opportunities. the optics are bad... and that alone justifies independent scrutiny and disclosure.

genuine error? trump makes a bad call, sees chaos, steps back.

regardless of intent, markets hate unpredictability. real people lost real money. a president whose family profits from the industry he regulates raises serious conflict of interest questions.

watch for : asset disclosures tied to policy moves. on-chain data for large wallet trades. congressional pressure for answers. if you were liquidated or sold during the panic, you're likely sitting on taxable events even if you lost money overall. capital losses can offset gains, but only if you report them correctly. given the volatility and political manipulation at play, accurate tax reporting matters more than ever (tools like awaken can help sort through the chaos of liquidations and trades during wild market swings).",2025-10-19T18:54:34,r/cryptocurrency,Gullible-Tale9114,1188,post

t3_1oj1ypd,"A sad admission and lesson for others I'm just going to be honest and hopefully anyone reading learns a lesson. Please don't give me hate. Pretty low right now.

I heavily invested into an alt coin (my posts history makes clear which) a few years ago with the typical belief that it was solving a real world problem and would continue development, making a healthy ROI. I was so very wrong. It's become apparent that the tokenomics have been completely manipulated and supply diluted, and all previous correspondence from the team deleted to cover their tracks. They're actively minting and dumping tokens as I write this.

I know I should have diversified my portfolio more. I know I shouldn't have trusted an alt coin. I know I shouldn't have invested more than I was willing to lose. I started my crypto journey in a pretty desperate position, that's why I took on elevated risk. But my situation has only become so much worse and I feel embarrassed and ashamed. It is no ones fault but mine for me choosing to invest, but I didn't expect to be fighting against a malicious, scamming team.

To be honest, I don't even know why I'm posting this here because I think people will just give me hate and make me feel worse. But either way I've just fucking ruined my financial future and no one can help me. It's a really strange feeling to accept absolute failure and say it out loud (well, type it I suppose). 

Don't be like me. I thought I was desperate, but this is another level. Doesn't feel like there's much point carrying on here now when only a miracle could shift my course. Oh well.

t3_1oo38yo,"My takeaway from being in crypto for 8+ years. I've been in crypto for a while now, and here's my key takeaways (might be wrong, might be right... so take it with a grain of salt).

- It looks like the 4 year cycle is doing it's thing again, like usual.

- The tops come a bit sooner every time. Why? Because people like me think ""I don't want to hold the bag again, the top will be in November, so let me make sure to get out a bit earlier than everyone else this time"".

- The market overall is less explosive due to the obvious reasons that the crypto market cap has become much bigger than 5-10 years ago, so doing 100x is basically impossible (other than niche meme coin pump and dumps) and even 10x is way less likely. Going forward it will be even less X. The world market just isn't big enough for that kind of growth, and with institutional investors in BTC it will generally become more stable.

- Alts performing worse with every cycle (again, there's exceptions, I'm speaking overall). Why? Because the market and the people are maturing, almost everyone has had contact with crypto at this point, and for most of them it was negative (i.e. loss, scams, rug pulls, pump and dumps, NFTs, etc). There's not enough ""greater fools"" to keep the explosion going like 5-10 years ago when this was fresh.


Basically: the market is maturing, it's not the same as it was 5-10 years ago. Back then, we were all ""younger/more naive"", we thought crypto is some kind of technological revolution that will change the world, all trying to strike the next golden alt coin. Reality? It's not been that. It's a giant casino ridden with scams. It's pure gambling. I will probably never invest in an alt coin again, and I'm glad that the only ""alt"" coin I've invested in this cycle was ETH. But other than that, I will be sticking to only BTC going forward, as I can personally even see ETH dying off (albeit very slowly), as it has performed worse this cycle. Or maybe it'll be the ""silver"" to the ""BTC gold"", but that's about it.

With this realization, I've actually made money this cycle, as I sold everything recently with a good profit. I won't be holding the bags anymore like I did in previous cycles, sucking on the hopium/copium. :) Going forward, it will be BTC only, probably DCAing into it during bear market and then trying to ""sell early"" before the next top crashes again. And the more and more people have this realization for themselves, the worse Alts will perform in comparison to BTC going forward.",2025-11-04T09:44:13,r/cryptocurrency,RandomJoe7,783,post

t3_1ouhqwq,"China just accused the US of conducting a state level hack to steal 13 billion in Bitcoin - this is wild Chinas National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center dropped a bombshell report accusing the US government of stealing 127k Bitcoin worth around 13 billion dollars. This is getting geopolitical fast.

The Bitcoin was originally stolen from Chinas LuBian mining pool back in December 2020. At the time it was worth about 3.5 billion but the hack did not get much mainstream attention. The coins then sat in the attacker’s wallets for years and only started moving in mid 2024 before ending up in addresses that analysts and China’s report now link to US authorities, and that the DOJ says it controls as of the seizure announced in October 2025.

Chinas argument is that normal criminals would cash out immediately. The fact these coins stayed dormant for about four years points to a state level operation not some random hacker looking for quick profit. They say the sophistication of the hack and the long dormancy proves it was government orchestrated.

The US Department of Justice seized the Bitcoin in October 2025 as part of a case against Chen Zhi who ran Cambodias Prince Group. They charged him with running a massive crypto fraud and forced labor scam network and said the seizure was a lawful criminal proceeds forfeiture. The DOJ has explicitly denied China’s “state level hack” accusation and says it had no involvement in the original theft.

Heres the thing tho. Chen Zhi apparently sent multiple messages on chain basically begging the hackers to return the Bitcoin and offering ransom. The hackers never responded which is weird if they were just criminals.

This batch of Bitcoin now represents about 39% of all BTC held by the US government based on on chain tracking of US controlled addresses. Trump recently said the US is far ahead of China in crypto adoption so this accusation comes at a politically charged moment.

Whether China has real evidence or this is just geopolitical posturing nobody knows yet. But it could spark what some analysts are already calling a crypto cold war between the two superpowers.",2025-11-11T18:46:04,r/cryptocurrency,hodorrny,762,post

t1_nohw6q5,"***From Business Insider's Lakshmi Varanasi:***

Coinbase is joining an ever-growing list of companies bidding farewell to Delaware.

The cryptocurrency exchange has filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission to leave Delaware and reincorporate in Texas, its chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, wrote in a column on Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal.

Texas has become ""an increasingly attractive hub for innovative companies like ours,"" Grewal wrote. ""It's a shame that it has come to this, but Delaware has left us with little choice.""

Delaware has long been considered one of the country's most business-friendly states. Nearly 2 million businesses call Delaware their legal home, including more than half of all publicly traded companies, according to the Delaware Secretary of State.

However, a series of Delaware court rulings has made some companies question just how hospitable the state really is for corporations.

""Delaware's Chancery Court in recent years has been rife with unpredictable outcomes,"" Grewal wrote.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sparked an exodus from the state last year, reincorporating both SpaceX and Tesla in Texas, after a Delaware court sided with minority shareholders to void his proposed $56 billion pay package. Now based in Texas, Tesla shareholders approved a $1 trillion pay package, tied to some lofty benchmarks, earlier this month. Texas law makes it more difficult for shareholders to file lawsuits against a company and its directors.

VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, Roblox, and Dropbox, and Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital have all left Delaware in the last year. Many of them have gone to Nevada, which, like Texas, has styled itself as more business-friendly in recent years.

For Coinbase, Texas offered more ""predictability,"" Grewal wrote.

Coinbase did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

t1_noilni9,"There are 2 main reasons that companies are re-incorporating in Texas:

1. Shareholders of the company cannot sue the company in Texas. In Delaware, as a shareholder you can sue the company if you believe they are not acting in the company's best interest (eg: when Tesla was sued by shareholders for offering Musk a $56 billion pay package).
2. Company officers cannot be held personally liable for decisions made as part of the company. So if a director performs some illegal or fraudulent act, you can sue the company, but the director who made the decision cannot face personal legal consequences.
   1. This only recently became the case after SBF was successfully held liable for fraud within FTX. This lawsuit is largely credited with the reason why Texas changed its laws to provide better protection to company directors, to ensure company directors can better make the decisions they need to run their company without fear of personal liability or overly zealous state investigations. 

There is also the fact that there is no state tax, but that's overall a very minor point. It isn't much money and most of these companies are not profitable anyway.",2025-11-12T20:28:00,r/cryptocurrency,_BreakingGood_,38,comment

t3_1oop6r8,"Bitcoin is only up ~53% on the 4 year chart... or ~36% adjusted for inflation. As comes as no surprise, literally every single prediction by every influencer and thought leader in the Bitcoin community about this cycle has been completely wrong.

Bitcoin is only up \~53% on the 4 year chart... or \~36% adjusted for inflation.

In the same amount of time, the S&P 500 is up 47% and gold is up 111%.

This is easily the worst performing 4 year period in Bitocin's history. Really makes you wonder about the 4 year cycle and diminishing returns.

Is Bitcoin cooked?

At this rate, if we're lucky, we can expect \~$180-$200k top for the next halving cycle around late 2029, which I'm not eve sure Bitcoin will be able to outperform the SP500 or gold for that matter.

I have to admit, I'm seriously disappointed in Bitcoin's performance. Adoption still isn't happening. I've been a Bitociner for 4.5 years now and I still do not know anyone who owns any. I never hear people talking about it in public or social settings and the few times I've ever brought it up, I get kinda blank stares.

Not to mention, it's clear form on chain metrics that long term holders and OG's are selling. So much for HODL.

Not really sure what to make of it at this point. I think $126k was the top and even if it wasn't, anything less than $160k isn't even double the previous ATH after adjusting for inflation. Some people think we'll make it to $140k this cycle, but even if we did, that's nothing to brag about.

Is this what we're to expect for Bitcoin moving forward? 53% gains every 4 years? What a joke.",2025-11-05T01:04:34,r/cryptocurrency,Vaginosis-Psychosis,612,post

t1_no7nbnr,"tldr; More Indians working abroad are using stablecoins like USDT for remittances due to a 4-5% premium in India, making it more lucrative than traditional bank transfers. For example, $1,000 sent via USDT fetches ₹93,150 compared to ₹88,600 through banks. This shift, accounting for 3-4% of remittances, is driven by quicker, cheaper transactions and higher returns. Money changers facilitate these transfers, often bypassing formal banking channels. Rising demand for USDT in India has sustained this trend, though flows remain small compared to traditional methods.

t1_nml1axu,"tldr; Bitcoin experienced its first October monthly loss in seven years, ending the month down 5%. The decline followed a record liquidation event triggered by President Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, which caused Bitcoin to drop from $126,000 to near $104,800. Market uncertainty, reduced risk appetite, and the Federal Reserve's resistance to further rate cuts contributed to the downturn. Despite the loss, Bitcoin remains up over 16% year-to-date.

t1_nlb3klu,"tldr; BlackRock, the world's largest investment firm, invested over $300 million in Bitcoin (BTC) through its Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, between October 20–24. The firm saw net inflows of $324.3 million, indicating strong institutional interest despite market volatility. This consistent buying pressure helped stabilize Bitcoin's price above $110,000. Analysts project bullish sentiment for Bitcoin, with some forecasting a $200,000 target in Q4. Bitcoin's broader trend remains upward, supported by long-term demand and institutional accumulation.

t3_1oq5b6n,"Another stablecoin blew up Elixir's tweet about the situation

>Elixir has worked tirelessly over the previous 48 hours and has successfully processed redemptions of 80% of all deUSD holders thus far (not including Stream).  
  
As it stands now, Stream holds roughly 90% of the deUSD supply (\~$75m), while Elixir holds a similar proportion of its remaining backing as a Morpho loan to Stream.  
  
All remaining holders of deUSD and sdeUSD will be able to redeem for a dollar.  
  
To protect the interest of these holders (and remove any risk of Stream liquidating deUSD before repaying their loan), a snapshot has been taken of all remaining deUSD and sdeUSD holder balances, and a claim page will go live later today. These parties will be able to claim USDC.  
  
As a part of this, the mint/redeem infrastructure has been turned off, and we will be sunsetting deUSD in the near future. Any affected LPs in AMM pools or lending markets will be able to claim the full value of their position.  
  
Given that Stream comprised of 99%+ of the lending positions (and has decided to not repay or close positions), we will work with Euler, Morpho, Compound and the curators moving forward to help distribute repayment of the Stream loan to liquidate these positions. We still believe this will be honored 1 for 1.  
  
We will follow up to this post later today with claim page information.

The wallet was protected by a complex seed phrase, which a data scientist decoded by identifying manipulated number sequences. The suspect refused to provide wallet keys, risking a 10-year penalty. The seized funds may be redistributed for crime prevention if ordered by the court. This marks another successful crypto recovery by the AFP digital forensics team.

t1_noitykg,"tldr; The cryptocurrency market lost $140 billion in value within five hours, with Bitcoin dropping 1.83% to $101,265 and Ethereum falling 1.64% to $3,397.55. Altcoins like XRP and Solana also saw significant declines. The downturn is attributed to uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy, inflation concerns, and delayed economic data due to a government shutdown. Bitcoin has retraced 17% from its October highs, and analysts warn of potential further declines. Despite this, institutional interest remains strong, with U.S. Bitcoin ETFs managing over $137 billion.

t3_1ogl2wq,"what actually caused CZ's pardon? Turns out it was months of expensive lobbying. CZ served 4 months in prison last year for violating antimoney laundering laws. got out, then Trump pardoned him. But according to Politico’s reporting and public lobbying filings, that pardon didn’t just happen... binance and CZ spent serious money trying to make it happen.

In late september, binance hired Ches McDowell ...described in multiple reports as tied to Trump’s circle and close to Donald Trump Jr.... to lobby the White House and treasury. his firm, Checkmate Government Relations, disclosed $450k for roughly one month’s work on “financial services policy and executive relief” targeting the White House Office and Treasury Department. And that’s just one piece of it.

In March, Zhao also hired Teresa Goody Guillén... a crypto lawyer who had been reported as under consideration for SEC chair.... to lobby the White House for “executive relief.” Reports indicate her firm has received around $290,000 from Binance and Zhao in 2025.

overall, reports put binance’s 2025 lobbying around $860k so far. separately, the trumplinked World Liberty Financial venture launched this year and has clear Trump family connections, though there’s no public filing showing a formal Binance partnership. Coverage describes significant paper gains and fundraising around that venture, with estimates and amounts varying across outlets.

Rep. Maxine Waters called the pardon a favor for “crypto criminals,” arguing it came after months of lobbying and money flowing into Trumplinked crypto ventures. Trump defended the move by saying Zhao “was persecuted by the Biden administration” and that what he did “wasn’t a crime.”

But CZ pleaded guilty to violating U.S. antimoneylaundering laws and accepted a fourmonth sentence. What’s clear is this wasn’t some random act of mercy ..... it followed a concentrated, expensive lobbying push aimed at senior executivebranch offices using Trumpworldconnected lobbyists. They hired heavyweight lobbyists, spent serious money, and operated within Trumplinked crypto circles throughout 2025.

It’s a pretty stark reminder of how deep regulation and influence now run in crypto. The same compliance systems that failed at the top are the ones regular investors are expected to handle on their own  accurately, every tax season, with no lobbyist to clean up the mess later.

That’s why a lot of traders I know have started automating the boring side tracking trades using awaken, wallets, and tax exposure in real time  just to stay ahead of the gray areas. Because in this space, *not knowing* the rules costs you more than any lobbying bill ever could.

Whether that’s just how Washington works or something closer to corruption depends on your perspective. But the pardon undeniably arrived after a costly and highly targeted influence campaign.",2025-10-26T13:48:45,r/cryptocurrency,Gullible-Tale9114,414,post

t3_1ogw0dq,"I built a website to track whales and insider/suspicious trades on Polymarket Hey everyone,

Recently, I got really interested in the idea that people might actually be trading on inside info on Polymarket.

Polymarket’s data is all public, it just isn’t easy to visualize or filter out all the sports bets and low-impact events. So I created [**Polywhaler**](https://www.polywhaler.com/): a website that tracks large whale trades and potentially suspicious activity across Polymarket in real time.

You can see:

* Every non-sports trade over $10k
* Which markets whales are suddenly piling into + trade impact on odds
* A calculated “insider score” (might suggest someone knows something)
* Add crypto wallets to your watchlist to track specific traders
* Discord alerts for live whale trades
* Crypto price prediction markets (experimental, but fun to track)

It’s still early and pretty barebones, but would love to hear feedback or feature ideas, especially from anyone who follows Polymarket or enjoys watching these new internet markets and how accurate they are on predicting events.

Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, condemned the pardon as an act of corruption, citing Zhao's lobbying efforts and connections to Trump's crypto ventures.

t3_1oanbqc,"Everyone panicked on October 10… but that’s just crypto being crypto. everyone freaked out but this is textbook bull market behavior. in every bull run you get 2 to 4 major pullbacks, usually around 30 to 45%. what we saw wasn’t even close to that.

so yeah, it hurts. but it’s not unexpected. it’s not the end of the bull run, it’s part of it.

here’s what actually happened with the tariff stuff

on october 10, trump announced a new 100% tariff on chinese goods. markets freaked out instantly. bitcoin dropped about 8% to roughly $104,782 on oct 10. global stocks and tech megacaps lost over $770 billion in value that day.
it triggered a broad sell off. traders rushed to de risk, and crypto saw huge liquidations… about $16 to $19 billion wiped out in the episode.

but this is the usual cycle. markets panic, then the fed steps in. if the sell-off continues, powell could cut rates to stabilize things. rate cuts mean more liquidity. liquidity pushes crypto back up.
if trade tensions ease or central banks step in with liquidity, markets typically recover. that is the dynamic traders are watching.

the pullback is kind of an opportunity tbh

when people panic sell, that’s usually when you want to buy. panic selling never works long term. if you believed in crypto at $110k, you should love it more at $104k. same asset, cheaper price.

i’ve been holding since 2017. i’ve seen much worse. the people who actually made money weren’t the ones who panic traded… they were the ones who held through the scary dips and kept buying.

here’s the macro math
bitcoin still moves with the global money supply. when liquidity expands, bitcoin rises. when it tightens, it drops. right now, governments can’t afford to tighten too hard without breaking something.
so eventually, more liquidity will come… and that’s when crypto climbs back.


the big picture stays bullish. short term pain, long term trend intact.

don’t use leverage. seriously. that’s how people get wiped. buy dips only with what you can afford to lose. if you panic sold or got liquidated, those are taxable events. capital losses from the dip can offset your gains from earlier in the year, but only if you report them properly. with all the volatility we've seen, tracking every trade manually is a nightmare. that's where tools like awaken.tax actually help… they pull your transaction history and calculate gains/losses automatically so you're not scrambling in april trying to remember what you sold at $104k versus $110k.

t1_nk8xcfh,"tldr; North Korean hackers are using a new technique called EtherHiding to embed malicious code into blockchain networks like Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain. This method leverages the immutable nature of blockchains to store and distribute malware via smart contracts, making it difficult to detect or remove. The attack often involves compromising websites and using JavaScript loaders to retrieve malware from blockchains. Experts warn this marks a shift from crypto theft to weaponizing blockchain systems for cyber warfare.

t1_njgcdjp,"tldr; Whales have offloaded 2.24 billion XRP tokens worth $5.4 billion, marking the highest selling pressure since December 2022. This massive sell-off has intensified bearish sentiment, with XRP trading at $2.44 and struggling to recover from a recent market crash. Investor confidence remains weak, and continued liquidations could push XRP prices down to $2.35 or $2.27. A rebound is possible if selling pressure eases, with key resistance levels at $2.54 and $2.75. Large-scale whale activity signals skepticism about XRP's near-term recovery potential.

The tax applies to individuals with net assets exceeding €2 million, including unrealized crypto gains, at a 1% rate. Investors must report all holdings, including foreign wallets, to avoid penalties. The law aims to encourage the productive use of wealth and generate revenue for public services. Critics argue it may discourage innovation and push investors to move funds out of France, potentially impacting the digital economy.

t3_1osly5h,"Ethereum Faces Critical Scaling Issue, Vitalik Admits Mistake Ethereum has been highly reliant on the Zero Knowledge Solutions like ZK Rollups. It had even bought blobs, temporary storage spaces in Ethereum L1 blocks, to reduce the cost that rollups pay to finalize their transactions on Ethereum

Further, Ethereum had also bought the Dencun Upgrade on March 13, 2024 and the Pectra Upgrade on May 7, 2025 to help rollups.

However, a past legacy solution remains a critical bottleneck for Ethereum Scaling called the “modexp precompile”.

ModeXP Precompile is an algorithm that enables the execution of highly complex operations, which other protocols, such as RSA, cannot perform.

When ModeXP was created around 2017, there were no Zero Knowledge Protocols. In the current scenario, they force the Zero Knowledge Rollup to simulate the Ethereum blockchain for every transaction in a particular summary.",2025-11-09T15:19:49,r/cryptocurrency,emperordas,237,post
t1_no1zkkk,"Simplified explanation for the inept:

Imagine you have a busy highway (Ethereum network + its scaling layers) and you want lots of cars (transactions) to pass through quickly, cheaply. You also have some new super-fast lanes (layer 2s + ZK-rollups) to help relieve congestion. Great.

But then there’s a single toll booth (the modexp precompile) that’s super slow whenever certain kinds of cars use it. It doesn’t stop all cars, only some kinds of cars (those requiring that particular crypto operation). But because these kinds of operations are common in some of the new scaling / ZK stuff, the slow booth backs up traffic, slows everything down, and raises costs.

So even though you’ve built the super-fast lanes, the toll booth still forces many cars into a jam or makes them pay a lot more. That means your overall highway throughput (transactions per second), or cost per car (gas/fees), gets worse than potential. And the new lanes don’t work as well or as cheaply as they could.",2025-11-10T04:22:31,r/cryptocurrency,puckmugger,132,comment
t1_nnxwpe2,"tldr; Ethereum is facing a critical scaling issue due to the 'modexp precompile,' an encryption algorithm created by Vitalik Buterin in 2017. This algorithm significantly slows down Zero Knowledge (ZK) rollups, which are essential for Ethereum's scalability. Vitalik admitted the algorithm was a mistake and proposed an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) to replace it with a more ZK-friendly solution. The current algorithm increases execution difficulty by up to 50 times, potentially causing consensus failures and negating the benefits of recent upgrades like Dencun and Pectra.

Almost every indicator I look for a healthy project is present with Vechain.  
Just to name a few.

\- Active, frequent community engagement on twitter(spaces), including Sunny who drops in sometimes. Anyone can ask questions as long as you keep it civil.  
\- Clear roadmap at the start of the year, keeping every deadline and delivering.  
\- You can tell from their github activity that they clearly increased the amount of developer working on the project.  
\- Vebetter DAO with ever increasing dApps. These dApps mostly using AI to fact check and there are many bad actors and there are dApps which let you earn actual money from just picking up your dog poop(which you should be doing anyway) and get rewards for it.  
There was a post where a user thanked the developers because this paid for their dog treatment.  
You can earn money from drying your cloths on the sun and not using a dryer. Taking photos of your reusable mug. There is many more what you may find fun but overall and what matters for many is money. Casually(!!) using the app can get you $$$ monthly, yes you saw that right.  
\- Veword wallet login for dApps that made by vechain. Kinda like how facebook, gmail login works but for dApps which streamlines and takes the pain out of login.  
\- DEX with liquidity that allows moderate swaps between coins.  
\- Credit card that supports B3TR(afaik its called Stella pay). Less step to spend your crypto.  
\- Credit card(s) that support VET/ VTHO. Revolute and more credit card will start support this chain after the 2025 Q4 Hayabusa update.  
\- Vechain going full decentralized by end of this year!!! Anyone can become a validator without KYC.  
\- Mentioned before, metamask support and every goodies that comes with having proper multichain DEX support. Metamask got a credit card too I believe.  
2020 finally said hi to Vechain, better late than never.

These are just the things I remember without thinking much about it.

Price wise vechain doing dogshit and I'm not too worried about it.  
It will be bad when every coin goes up but vechain a.k.a not rising with the tide. This never happened so far.  
It will be bad if vechain is only rising with the tide and not gaining momentum. This never happened either.  
Whenever the bull market for alt started, Vechain was pulling ahead of others.

Last bullrun Vechain went even lower than now. Bloodbath is a gentle word to describe how bad it was YET vechain ended up being top 15 on CMC after a crazy run.

Not saying this is going to happen again, just saying its too early to worry about the price action.",2025-10-30T09:51:20,r/cryptocurrency,JuniorPosition9631,61,comment

t3_1o78gkw,"Economist Peter Schiff says Bitcoin’s failure to rise with gold means the party is over. Economist and gold advocate Peter Schiff shared his view following gold’s surge above $4,200, arguing that Bitcoin’s lack of movement alongside gold signals weakness rather than delayed strength.

“Bitcoiners are convinced that gold's historic rise means Bitcoin will not only follow gold's lead, but soon surpass its performance. However, it’s more likely that Bitcoin's failure to rise with gold means the party is over. Instead of a catch-up boom, expect a belated bust.”

This technique, called EtherHiding, uses blockchain smart contracts to store malicious code, making it nearly impossible to disrupt due to the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchains. The approach combines social engineering with blockchain-based malware delivery, allowing attackers to evade detection and update payloads while minimizing costs and leaving no trace.

t1_nm4aiu0,The fact that markets tanked immediately after the cut shows how much we trade on sentiment and speculation rather than fundamentals. Rate cuts used to be bullish signals but now everyone is trying to guess what the Fed will do next instead of focusing on building real value. This applies to crypto too where we see massive liquidations from overleveraged positions trying to time macro moves. The smarter play is finding projects with genuine use cases that can weather volatility instead of chasing pumps based on Fed predictions. Battle SOL caught my attention because theyre focused on sustainable gameplay mechanics rather than relying on hype cycles tied to rate decisions. Building during uncertainty is how you position for the next real bull run not leverage trading on Powell speeches.,2025-10-30T01:45:17,r/cryptocurrency,hollmarck,3,comment

t1_njrfzmc,"tldr; Ant Group, the Chinese fintech giant behind Alipay, has launched Jovay, a new Layer-2 blockchain built on Ethereum, to integrate real-world assets (RWAs) into decentralized finance at an institutional scale. Jovay aims to provide a compliance-first, scalable solution without a native token, targeting enterprise adoption. With Alipay's 1.4 billion users, Jovay could significantly expand Ethereum's role in global finance. The platform achieved up to 22,000 TPS in trials and aims for 100,000 TPS, signaling a shift toward public blockchain infrastructure for institutional finance.

t1_nl973m4,"tldr; Alan Turing (1912–1954) was a pioneering English mathematician, computer scientist, and cryptanalyst, widely regarded as the father of theoretical computer science. He developed the concept of the Turing machine, a model for general-purpose computation, and played a crucial role in breaking German ciphers during World War II at Bletchley Park. Post-war, he contributed to early computer development and mathematical biology. Despite his achievements, Turing faced persecution for his homosexuality, leading to his tragic death in 1954. He was posthumously pardoned and honored for his contributions.

* Blackrock (the biggest asset manager in the world);

* Visa (the biggest card payment company in the world);

* UBS (the biggest private bank in the world).


If we look beyond the absolute biggest then you will notice that WisdomTree, JPMorgan, HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Fidelity, Franklyn Templeton etc etc all also have RWA tokenization projects built on Ethereum and its L2 ecosystem.


You can find links to all of those (and over a hundred more mainstream companies' Ethereum based projects) at: https://ethereumadoption.com/built-on-ethereum/


Obviously not all of the adoption by financial institutions is just tokenization. Paypal Robinhood and Venmo have all got various projects like stablecoins, L2s, ENS integration etc. 


EY (one of the 'Big Four' global accounting firms) have accepted payment for their services through stablecoins on Ethereum, and actively contribute to the chain's infrastructure development (most notably with their privacy protocol 'Nightfall').

t3_1oni5d1,"Quitting after 4 years of trading - my stats **Overall stats:**

5 exchanges | 48 cryptocurrencies | \~250 transactions | -$92,000 CAD

**History:**

I got into crypto right before the pumpiest days in 2021 and therefore was hooked on the quick profits I was able to quickly make. Got so excited that I even took some money out of the credit line to invest into crypto. Wasn't fine paying it all back while watching everything crash for a whole year in 2022. 

Got more cautious and tried to time things, experimented with position sizes, types of crypto, different signals, etc. Nothing worked for consistent results. I thought I had figured something out when I made \~$27,000 profit in 2024 but when I saw that most of the altcoins I held kept going down in 2025 I realized I have no idea what I'm doing. Decided to sell most bags and when I saw that the resulting net was -108k CAD, I realized how much of a dumbass I have been. Nothing I've thought of or devised worked, I just lost a shit ton of my money and time.

The whole thing seems like a scam to me. The sheer amount of information, types of currencies, types of ""rewards"", number of exchanges, and just factors to consider is designed to confuse and distract. You lose track of what's what. Even with manually trying to track what is going where in spreadsheets, plotting and recording trades in Tradingview, using budgeting software to track which funds go into which account... none of that helped in the end. 

Looking back, the conclusion is that I should have only been buying BTC and ETH. Everything else went through unpredictable rollercoasters or crashed to the bottoms of hell. So at this point I am out I don't trust myself to make any decisions about individual investments anymore. Will just put any savings into index funds and forget about looking at charts until retirement.",2025-11-03T17:33:03,r/cryptocurrency,0mnipath,192,post

t1_nko9pou,">Melania Trump Used as'Window-Dressing' in Elaborate Memecoin Fraud, Legal Filing Claims The first lady of the United States became a pawn in an intricate memecoin scam that resulted in millions of dollars in losses, crypto investors have alleged. A cryptocurrency promoted in January by US first lady Melania Trump was part of a sophisticated fraud that ""leveraged celebrity association and'borrowed fame' to sell legitimacy to unsuspecting investors,"" a new legal filing has alleged. In April, crypto investors brought a federal class action lawsuit against Benjamin Chow, cofounder of crypto exchange Meteora, and Hayden Davis, cofounder of crypto venture capital firm Kelsier Labs, among other defendants, accusing them of a multimillion-dollar fraud involving a single memecoin, $M3M3. Later, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, expanding the allegations to include racketeering activity. They claimed the pair had colluded to rig the market for $LIBRA, a coin promoted by Javier Milei, president of Argentina, which collapsed in value shortly after launch.

So apparently nothing filed against Melania / Trump directly. I didn't see the whole article since it was paywalled, but kinda weird that they don't even name who filed it. 

But on   
[https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70237496/hurlock-v-kelsier-ventures/](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70237496/hurlock-v-kelsier-ventures/)

Looks like it's a guy named Jonathan Clarke along with Rodrigo Ferreira Da Cruz Vogt, and when he first filed it, he filed it incorrectly lol. 

Not saying that all the Trump crypto stuff is okay, but it's sorta clickbait too. Kind of interesting at least.

>“Publicly, M3M3 was presented as a Meteora project,” the suit reads. “In reality, M3M3 was a collaboration between Meteora and Chow, on the one hand, and defendant Kelsier, a venture capital firm run by the Davis defendants (a father and two sons),” adding that the defendants concealed their involvement.""",2025-10-21T21:37:57,r/cryptocurrency,brucekeller,4,comment

t3_1okyp7d,"100 top crypto influencers enter trading competition - only 19 in profit Synthetix Exchange is currently running a trading competition among 100 top crypto influencers. Each influencer was given $50,000 to trade on the platform.

As of now:

* Only 19 of the 100 traders have a positive PnL (meaning their account balance is above $50,000).
* 7 participants have made no trades at all, placing them between ranks 20–26 by default.
* 32 traders have lost 99% or more of their starting balance, meaning their accounts now hold less than $500.

This is a perpetual futures DEX, meaning traders can go long or short. Since it's a perp-dex, their performance isn’t tied to simple market direction because they can profit whether prices go up (long) or down (short) if they predict correctly. Despite that flexibility, the majority are losing heavily.

It’s a reminder that most influencers don’t make their money through trading. Their income often comes from deal flow, sponsorships, or promoting the platforms they appear to be using successfully. Many are subsidized or incentivized to generate high volume, creating the illusion of skill or profitability.

If they do make money trading, it's frequently by buying small cap coins early and shilling it later. These small caps are rarely put on perp dexes so they don't have this advantage.

Events like this pull back the curtain. Even with a fair playing field and access to the same tools as everyone else, very few of the so-called “top traders” can actually trade profitably.

The stock fell to a market cap of $65.34 billion, below the $66.59 billion value of its 641,692 Bitcoin, creating a rare negative premium. This reflects a shift in market behavior, with traders favoring direct Bitcoin exposure over corporate proxies like MicroStrategy. Despite the dip, the stock quickly recovered, highlighting the volatility tied to MicroStrategy's capital strategy and operational risks.

t3_1oaa4ni,"Fear and greed is at 25 yet BTC didn't even brake out of the range... Hope you survived last friday. Another proof that you shouldn't gamble on perps more then you're willing to loose.   
And its just that - gambling. Not investing. Just placing occasional one direction bets.   
It’s been exactly 7 days since the biggest crypto liquidation ever - $19 billion wiped in a few hours. Everyone was overleveraged on HP, Aster, other dexs. I guess if i was the biggest cex by volume, i would also use my own books to price assets instead of relaying on some 3rd party. Loss of speed is main concern, but history gave us different lesson.

Now the question is, was that *the flush* or just the beginning? After all, we're between 2 interest cut rates...

BTC dropped hard but still holding the range. Around 108k down to 106k is where things got ugly. If we drop under 100k, next stops are like 98–94k. I personally don’t see it staying below that long. Weekly close above 100k keeps us safe. Below = probably panic zone.

ETH actually looks stronger, still chilling around 3.8k. As long as it closes above that, range intact. Below that, 2.8k is next. SOL also holding like a champ around 84–89, even after four red days.

Everyone’s doomposting right now. Fear and greed Index is deep in *fear*, not extreme fear yet, but close. That’s usually when the best entries happen. I’m not saying ape in, but historically this is where smart money starts scaling in.

Also worth noting: the global liq index broke its downtrend back in March and is ranging sideways. That’s good. Liquidity drives everything. More liquidity → higher risk appetite → higher BTC

Gold’s at ATH, institutions aren’t selling BTC, and Trump’s probably pushing rate cuts again. Feels like sentiment is way more bearish than fundamentals.

If BTC does sweep 95–98k, I think it’s a shakeout before another bounce. Not financial advice, just saying… these levels feel like fear is peaking.",2025-10-18T23:02:38,r/cryptocurrency,ZhenyaV,166,post

t3_1oibkb0,"I have seen a lot of “if you pay crypto taxes you’re a moron.” ok champ… let’s talk crypto isn’t untraceable. most networks are public ledgers and your wallet history lives there forever. the name might not be on the address, but one kyc deposit or withdrawal ties the real you to that trail. on-ramps do kyc, agencies use blockchain analytics, and once a single touchpoint is linked, a lot of the rest can be inferred.

why people still get caught is boring and simple. exchanges file reports and answer lawful requests. banks flag big cash outs. your on-chain life leaves loud breadcrumbs… nfts, staking rewards, bridge receipts, lp tokens, all of it. then the mismatch letters show up because you sold on exchange a, didn’t file anything, and the agency already has the data. easy pickings.

what actually gets taxed depends on your country, but the usual story is the same. selling for fiat, swapping coin a for coin b, or spending crypto counts as a disposal. staking, mining, airdrops, yield, referral payouts, all usually hit as income at fair market value when you receive them. nft flips are typically capital gains. stablecoin interest is usually ordinary income. and if your records vanished with a dead exchange, it’s still on you to reconstruct cost basis.

the faceplants are also predictable. a 1099 or local equivalent isn’t “profit,” it’s gross proceeds or rewards. you still need cost basis to get to real gains or losses. people ignore coin to coin trades. they treat defi like a black box when swaps, providing and pulling liquidity, and wrapping can all be taxable events. privacy coins or mixers add privacy, they don’t grant legal immunity. and losing your seed phrase often means losing your paper trail too.

there’s a simple way to stay clean without losing your mind. list every venue you touched and pull the data early… csvs from exchanges, full on chain history for your addresses. rebuild cost basis using your jurisdiction’s rules like fifo or specific id. tag income correctly at value on receipt. mark self transfers so they don’t look like sales. reconcile year end balances to what your ledger says. save everything… tx hashes, screenshots, csvs… in a folder per tax year. tools help here..you can use a tool for that I personally use awaken to match on chain lots to exchange reports so my numbers aren’t vibes as it saves me a lot of time… use whatever you trust, just don’t wing it. if you messed up, amend sooner not later. if your setup is complex, a crypto literate tax pro is worth it.

you can still care about privacy the legal way. use fresh addresses for new contexts and avoid reusing receive addresses. self-custody is fine, just keep meticulous records. think twice about doxxing wallets with public usernames. if you touch privacy tools, know your local rules before you do.

The bottom line is…you can be pro-privacy and still pro-compliance. the chain is more transparent than people think and the tax machine is more automated than it used to be. if you like sleeping at night, treat crypto like any other investment or income stream… track it, report it, move on with your life.
not tax or legal advice… rules vary by country… talk to a professional for your specifics.",2025-10-28T14:54:59,r/cryptocurrency,hodorrny,153,post

t1_nn1oabl,"tldr; The cryptocurrency market suffered a major crash, losing $270 billion in value within 24 hours, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP experiencing significant declines. The downturn was triggered by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments on interest rates, which dampened risk sentiment. A stronger U.S. dollar and increased derivatives activity, including a long squeeze, further exacerbated the sell-off. Altcoins like Solana and XRP saw steep drops, and traders are now focused on upcoming macroeconomic data for potential market impacts.

t3_1o8xjfm,"Two months ago— Coinbase told us a full scale alt season was coming The Altcoin Season That Wasn't

The crypto community had a moment of genuine excitement on August 14, 2025, when Coinbase published its bullish assessment, signaling that a ""full-scale alt season"" was on the immediate horizon. 

The Downward Spiral

Instead of soaring, altcoins began a substantial and painful drop almost immediately following, and in the months after, the article's publication. The clearest sign of this sentiment shift can be seen in the Altcoin Season Index, a metric intended to gauge the health and momentum of the altcoin space. From its peak in September, this index has collapsed by approximately 68%.
The carnage hasn't been limited to the index, either. Individual tokens across the board have suffered deep corrections, with many popular altcoins seeing their values plunge by anywhere from 50% to a staggering 80% from their local highs. This widespread decline paints a picture of a fearful and risk-averse market.
Compounding this loss of capital, the Total Market Cap Excluding Bitcoin (Total2)—a key indicator for the collective size of the altcoin market, saw its valuation shrink significantly, falling from around $1.7 trillion down to approximately $1.3 trillion.

TLDR; the altcoin market has gone from anticipating a feast to enduring a famine, with most coins seeing devastating losses since one of the industry's biggest players suggested the good times were about to start.

t3_1offh3e,"My true thoughts on Cardano Long time holder here

Never thought I’d be writing this but here we are.

Cardano today is not where I thought it would be when I first bought in January 2021.

At the time we were sold on the idea that Cardano would “change the world” and that we would “bank the unbanked”

Today we are no closer to that vision in my opinion.

Don’t get me wrong. I’ve had some personal success working with projects early on writing content and such. It’s now my full time job.

But I’ve been immensely disappointed by progress on many fronts including scaling, native USDC, support for content creators like myself, and overall lack of support for builders.

I also thought that governance would be the thing that really brings Cardano forward. But it’s brought a ton of infighting

The community always seems to be fighting about what proposal gets funded and what doesn’t. And it’s exhausting. And demoralizing 

Catalyst, a grant fund, seems as though it’s been somewhat corrupted by people who know how to work the system to get money to fund unprofitable projects

But that’s a separate issue

I’ve been diversified out of Ada for a while now because of the above reasons and more.

I was a long time, hardcore advocate for Cardano in the early days especially in this subreddit. Now not so much.

In terms of Defi, the rest of the industry has surged way ahead of Cardano and it’s not even close. 

I’ve learned a lot since coming into crypto in 2019. 

I think the most important lesson I’ve learned is to just try everything and not lock myself down too hard into one place.

I’m grateful for all the opportunities I’ve been awarded nonetheless and especially grateful for all the friendships I’ve made.

At this point I can call some of them my fam.

Those are my raw thoughts on Cardano

Opti out 

Edit: for what’s its worth, I say this as someone who’s been deeply embedded in the Cardano community for a long time.

t1_nn0xjah,"tldr; Ether fell as much as 9%, dropping below $3,600, following a hack of the Ethereum-based decentralized finance protocol Balancer, which reportedly lost over $100 million. This event adds to recent bearish trends in the crypto market, including macroeconomic factors like U.S.-China trade tensions and Federal Reserve comments on interest rates. The hack and broader market volatility have led to a sell-off in digital assets, with related stocks like Coinbase also experiencing declines.

I am 20 and a full time stem student so I don’t have a job since my number one priority is school and don’t want to risk falling behind in case work takes up my time. Instead I just recently got into crypto and saw meme coin trading but I know most people just lose money instead of gaining money. I also know most people who say they get rich are just lying about their gains.

Bhutan has successfully migrated its national digital identity system to Ethereum, becoming the first country to implement a national ID on the Ethereum blockchain. This system covers nearly 800,000 residents and allows citizens to access government services and authenticate themselves on a decentralized network. The migration, expected to be fully completed by Q1 2026, offers greater stability, transparency, and self-sovereign identity control. The initiative was supported by key figures like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay.

t1_nntibiq,"tldr; Older Bitcoin whales, holding BTC for over seven years, are selling heavily, with over 1,000 BTC/hour being spent in 2025. This selling pressure, including significant transactions by whales like 'Bitcoin OG Owen Gunden,' has contributed to Bitcoin's price decline, currently 18.7% below its all-time high of $126,000. Analysts warn of a potential drop to $89,600 if Bitcoin breaks below key support levels. While some view this as a normal market cycle, others attribute it to long-term holders cashing out, raising concerns about further price declines.

t3_1o92lvk,"Four year cycle update and what comes next Here's a table of BTC's price peaks. 

|Price Peak Date|Days Since Halving|Days Since Last Peak|Bear Drawdown|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nov 30, 2013|368||\-85%|
|Dec 16, 2017|525|1477|\-84%|
|Nov 9, 2021|547|1424|\-77%|
|Oct 7, 2025|535|1428|?|

In the short term BTC follows tech stocks and other factors, but long term the four year cycle has been surprisingly consistent. This could all be coincidence, but I think it's a self fulfilling prophesy at this point.

Especially given the recent price action, I think it's clear that the high for this cycle was October 7th. The returns between cycle peaks have been lessening over time, but the drawdowns in bear markets have been consistent, with price drops between 77% and 85% to the new lows. If that trend holds then BTC will go under $30K from here.

Maybe this time is different with tradfi involved, and maybe boomers (or taxpayers?) will hold everyone's crypto bags this time around. You should just know what you're up against holding BTC at this point in the cycle.",2025-10-17T14:20:05,r/cryptocurrency,MerkleChainsaw,115,post

\-gold is still rallying, for a good reason.

\-the stock market is still too greedy.

Also, for the bubble to pop, you first need a proper bubble. Remember what they say about market irrationality.

Ask yourself this:

Does it feel like things were feeling too bullish recently? Has the price gone way beyond conservative expectations? Was there a little too much fomo and mania?

At some point it will crash down, because like you said, cycles have been stronger than any other outside force.

t1_nnuhrss,The bet returns 50/50 if be it her happens by a certain date in like 2026.  So the 48 percent chance is really tracking the probability that neither will happen.,2025-11-08T23:34:42,r/bitcoin,UrbanPugEsq,93,comment
t1_nnuk7kb,"That's not how Polymarket works. The bets don't continue indefinitely into the future - they have an end date, and if we reach the end date and neither thing has happened, the bet returns 50/50. 

With the current 48% odds, this means that if neither Bitcoin $1M nor GTA 6 happen before the market closes in 2026, the people who bet on GTA 6 happening first would make a small amount of money, and the people who bet on Bitcoin would lose a small amount of money.

If either thing actually happens before the end date, you'd either roughly double your money, or straight up lose your money. 

Most people betting on this market expect neither to actually materialize, but expect future news to cause a shift where one becomes slightly more likely than the other, some time between now and the end date. Then they'll cash out their position and make (or lose) a small amount of money, but few people will hold until the very end.",2025-11-08T23:49:46,r/bitcoin,usicafterglow,84,comment

t3_1oklzwg,"BTC will go very very high (to 1 million and to 10 million per coin) Bros i don’t even have to do charts anymore. 

no TA, no on-chain, no halving cycles, nothing ( I know I said logic and numbers before).  But i’ve cracked the real formula for why bitcoin will go VERY VERY HIGH.

see, back in the early 2010s i had close to 50 btc. yeah. i sold them all when it hit around $300 because i thought i was a genius. since then i’ve been secretly wishing for bitcoin to crash… like really crash… just so i could feel smart again.

  
but the universe looked me dead in the eye and said “nah bro, you’re gonna watch this thing moon forever.”

that’s it. that’s the logic. not supply and demand, not S2F, not macro trends! 

just pure universal spite. bitcoin’s one and only mission is to make *me personally* feel bad.  
so if you see it going up, remember: it’s not because of ETFs or adoption or halving.. it’s because the universe hates me and wants to rub it in.

and for that reason alone, it’s going to go VERY. VERY. HIGH.

No.

$10k → $25k → $50k

…and did nothing.

Then watched $50k drop to $20k

…and still did nothing.

Then watched $20k climb to $65k → fall to $16k → rise again to $125k

t1_nmpozh2,"This is why it's critical to have conviction in Bitcoin. Anything new but extremely valuable will be volatile until the market figures it out.

Here's another real life scenario that played out. Someone bought 80,000 bitcoin around 2011 for $50,000. They held it until this year and sold for around $10 BILLION. If they had paper hands they would have sold at some lower price. Some will tell them, 'what if you died and never got to enjoy any of it?'. What about the dips?

All you have to have is conviction that BTC is going to $10M per coin and beyond. BTC rewards you the longer you hold it. If that person held to $1M per coin, they'd have $100 Billion instead of 10.

The best investors are those who do basically nothing at all. Bitcoin naturally encourages a low-time preference meaning a willingness to wait for reward down the road opposed to instant gratification.",2025-11-02T15:05:56,r/bitcoin,numbersev,8,comment

t3_1opk0kk,"France Plans 1% Tax on Unrealized Gains, Including Bitcoin French lawmakers have approved the first step of a proposal to replace the country’s property wealth tax with a broader levy on “non-productive wealth.”

The measure would affect assets such as Bitcoin, jewelry, art, yachts, and real estate, applying a flat 1% annual tax even if the assets haven’t been sold.

Supporters argue it will encourage investment in productive sectors, while critics warn it could penalize savers and reignite debate over the former ISF wealth tax abolished in 2017.",2025-11-06T00:15:04,r/bitcoin,Impossible-Chair8427,724,post

The French working class have a hair trigger for immediately and severely (legally) protesting.


The government first tried to come for them by removing social safety nets and worker protections.


Then the government came for the upper middle class by inflating the currency.


Now finally the government is coming for the rich. Not because they are out of greed, but because they cannot balance the budget.

Next thing you know we are near ATH again but you sold your stack hoping to buy back cheaper. Now you're out of the game until next cycle. That's usually how it works.

I received a lot of advice, and there were five users who helped me with some satoshis. I won’t mention their names, but I’m very grateful to them because, thanks to Bitcoin’s existence, they were able to send money quickly and easily to someone in Africa, in Angola, a place where the minimum wage is less than $70. With their help, I’ll be able to buy a computer, and I’ll only need a good internet connection, which I’ll get very soon. I will use the satoshis in the best way possible to learn more about Bitcoin and spread this technology in my country.

t3_1osv2ib,"Major catalyst just happened, the big short is coming Everyone keep talking about the 2000$ stimulus check 

Which is bullish i agree. 

Don’t sleep on the 50yrs mortgage tho! It’s a big bet by millennials that they will buy a house and pay a monthly check in a currency that will grow weaker and weaker every year

This is the beginning of the big short against the American dollar 

Every loan being taken will be just an improved short position against USD. 

This loan is an incredible deal, anyone who skips it, is a massive idiot. But it’s also another nail into the already clinically dead Dollar. It’s baffling why would Trump do this. 

Anyhow, if this happens it is massively bullish for bitcoin,  like a huge economic macro.

i am moving my 1M target to 2029.

I have to add, if i had to bet, i would bet those things won’t happen. Trump is a pathological liars and these moves are very out of character given his economic background",2025-11-09T21:17:58,r/bitcoin,Snoo-10598,647,post

t3_1oh4114,"Gold silver scam A friend bought gold & silver bars ~10 years ago. Now, when prices are high, he went to sell them… and boom — turns out it was a scam.

The “gold” was actually Nordic gold (copper + zinc + aluminum), and the silver was just copper plated. They only found out when the buyer did an acid test and machine scan. Even the inside of the bar looked real at the time of purchase.

Lesson: Even stamped gold isn’t always safe. Scams are real.

With BTC, the blockchain verifies everything — not some fake 999.99 stamp.

* The Department of Justice has seized about $15 billion worth of bitcoin held by a man who oversaw a massive “pig butchering” fraud operation based in Cambodia, prosecutors said.
* The seizure is the largest forfeiture action by the DOJ in history.
* An indictment charging the alleged pig butcherer, Chen Zhi, was unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.

The Department of Justice has seized about $15 billion worth of bitcoin
 held in cryptocurrency wallets owned by a man who oversaw a massive “pig butchering” fraud operation based in Cambodia, prosecutors said Tuesday.

The seizure is the largest forfeiture action by the DOJ in history.

An indictment charging the alleged pig butcher, Chen Zhi, was unsealed Tuesday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.

Zhi, who is also known as “Vincent,” remains at large, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York.

Zhi was identified in court filings as the founder and chairman of Prince Holding Group, a multinational business conglomerate based in Cambodia, which operates dozens of business entities in more than 30 countries.

The Prince Group’s operation included “forced-labor scam compounds across Cambodia,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a press release.

“Individuals held against their will in the compounds engaged in cryptocurrency investment fraud schemes, known as ‘pig butchering’ scams, that stole billions of dollars from victims in the United States and around the world,” the release said.

The scams duped people contacted via social media and messaging applications online into transferring cryptocurrency into accounts controlled by the scheme with false promises that the crypto would be invested and produce profits, according to the office.

“In reality, the funds were stolen from the victims and laundered for the benefit of the perpetrators,” the release said. “The scam perpetrators often built relationships with their victims over time, earning their trust before stealing their funds.”

Prosecutors said that hundreds of people were trafficked and forced to work in the scam compounds, “often under the threat of violence.”

Zhi and a network of top executives in the Prince Group are accused of using political influence in multiple countries to protect their criminal enterprise and paid bribes to public officials to avoid actions by law enforcement authorities targeting the scheme, according to prosecutors.",2025-10-14T15:35:36,r/bitcoin,Fluid_Garden8512,545,post

t3_1o8nloo,"Now a Whole Coiner Please note: For privacy purposes, this is not my main account. I will not respond to any DMs.

I finally did it. As of today, Oct 17, 2025, I’m officially a whole coiner. To me, this is a big personal accomplishment. I also have this sense of “relief” that I finally achieved this goal. No one can predict what will happen in the future, but I’m highly confident in BTC’s future and that owning BTC is one of the best life choices I’ve made. For me, it’s partly about building generational wealth. Whatever short-term market volatility is just noise. I’m looking at the big picture. My BTC is secured with a cold wallet with my seed phrase etched in steel plate and stored in a vault. Now to slowly work on accumulating a second coin…

Anyway, if you’re reading this post, thank you for reading. No one, except for my wife, is aware of my BTC (and I’ll keep it that way). So, I just wanted to share this happy personal moment at least anonymously. Cheers!

Edit: I'm sorry for not responding to all your comments. I didn't expect so many comments. Thank you all! I've been busy as my wife gave birth to my second child. Baby care is very time consuming.",2025-10-17T00:56:48,r/bitcoin,BTCWholeCoiner,487,post

Bitcoin is cash you can send instantly and safely anywhere around the globe. So if the Earth has a 40,000 kilometer circumference, it's like you extended the reach of your arm from 1 meter to 20,000,000 meters (halfway around the globe should suffice to reach anyone).

t3_1oherdt,"What if the real Bitcoin bull run starts after everyone gives up in 2025? I’ve been thinking a lot about Bitcoin’s price action this year, and something just feels *off*. It’s been unusually quiet.. almost *suppressed?* Historically, we’d be deep into the parabolic phase of the 4-year cycle by now, but instead, Bitcoin seems to be held back.

Here’s my theory:  
We might be witnessing deliberate suppression by powerful players, the kind of “elites” who understand Bitcoin’s long-term potential and want to ensure that *most people never get to own much of it*.

Think about it, it’s now Q4 2025, and everyone’s expecting a market top soon. Many holders are probably planning to sell, expecting a brutal bear market in 2026 (just like in past cycles). Meanwhile, the Fed is pivoting, lowering rates and ending QT.

So what happens?  
If Bitcoin doesn’t go parabolic by the end of this year, a lot of people will lose faith. They’ll sell, sit on the sidelines, and wait for a “classic” 50–60% drop next year to buy back in cheaper.

But what if that drop *never comes*?

What if, instead, early 2026 is when Bitcoin *finally* takes off, breaking far above $200k when most retail investors are out of the market, expecting a bear? By then, the big players (who’ve been quietly accumulating) will already hold massive positions. They won’t let Bitcoin dump again because they know it’s the future of money and they’ll want to control the scarce supply before it becomes completely out of reach for regular people.

So maybe 2025’s “boring” price action is the setup. The real move might start when everyone’s least expecting it, right after most people sell.

t1_nlnndq1,"My strategy is to DCA by referencing CMC fear and greed index

Extreme greed - 50 USD per day
Greed - 100 USD per day 
Neutral - 200 USD per day
Fear - 500 USD per day 
Extreme fear - 1k USD per day

Take last 1 year for example (very inaccurate scrolling on the graph) 
- extreme fear : 5 days or 5k USD
- fear: 10 weeks or 35k USD
- neutral: 7 months or 42k USD
- greed: 3 months or 10k USD
- extreme greed : 1 month: 1500 USD
Total 90K USD per year 

The key idea is to invest daily, I just fine tune the amount based on Fear Greed index.

Essentially forcing you to buy more at the bottom if you want to see good gains and really grow past inflation.

t3_1ob24bg,"Bitcoin Conspiracy I’ve been deep-diving into Bitcoin’s history lately, and I can’t shake the feeling that there’s more to the story than we’re told.

Think about it — it was created by an anonymous figure (or group) who vanished right after launch. Governments and institutions that once called it “dangerous” are now quietly investing in it. Meanwhile, huge mining operations in certain countries control a massive share of the hash rate, and ETF approvals seem to come right when retail hype spikes.

It’s almost as if Bitcoin, which started as a symbol of financial freedom, is slowly being pulled into the same centralized power structures it was meant to escape.

What if that’s been the plan all along?
What if “decentralization” is just the illusion keeping everyone hooked while institutions quietly consolidate control behind the scenes?

As for the conspricy theory, there's one simple question. Why would those already in power design something to give up SOME of their power, such as money printing and banking, only to consolidate control again?",2025-10-19T22:16:27,r/bitcoin,HedgehogGlad9505,161,comment

Everything that actually matters in bitcoin (the underlying code) has been developed out in public, in full transparency. You can verify it for yourself, as well as verify what is happening on the chain (maximum supply, issuance schedule etc). There's not much room for a conspiracy to happen  :)  

What happens on the market is a different thing, but markets cannot dictate what happens with your bitcoin in your own custody. Nor can ""centralized power structures"" do that, or control bitcoin otherwise.",2025-10-19T21:59:24,r/bitcoin,TheGreatMuffin,147,comment

Long-term holders sell sometimes, especially now that the market cap is large enough that they can do so without crashing the market. Let them sell, diversify, whatever.  The end result is that more people will now own Bitcoin, there will be less sell pressure and it will continue to go up in a probably ""boring"" manner as it has done for most of this year.

In short: it lets smart contracts verify real EMV chip transactions directly on-chain using RSA-2048 signatures (the same cryptography your physical card uses) and then settle funds in stablecoins through smart contracts.

If this went live, it would mean your card could trigger a payment that settles instantly on an EVM chain instead of through VISA’s centralized network. Merchants could receive instant, programmable, and transparent payments in USDC or any ERC-20 token... with fees, taxes, and royalties distributed automatically on-chain.

Have in mind that merchants *do not receive* funds when you swipe your card. These are settled in up to 7 days later (normally the day after). They also pay considerable fees.

It’s basically VISA rails, but open, auditable, and programmable... a bridge between traditional EMV hardware and decentralized settlement.

No more ""swap your stables for fiat so that you can swipe a card"". All merchant payment terminals are compatible and can be jail broken....",2025-11-04T14:05:59,r/ethereum,rhythm_of_eth,31,comment

t1_nmnrwf9,"I’m fresh home from a banger of a wedding. I’ve been DJing Weddings for years.   I love putting smiles on peoples faces.

Anyway, I guess all I gotta say is I’m so incredibly bullish on Ethereum… just look at that massive liquidation. We went through within the last 30 days and here we are sitting on the cusp of $4000 again…. And again and again and again.

The levy is gonna break to the upside. It’s nothing but a numbers game at this point.

We have so many Stablecoin metrics and other regulatory metrics that are just going bonkers. Hang in there.

It’s all going to be so fun to be so right. Keep your horizons long-term.

On a sidenote, thanks to Paul Brody. I’ve been invited to give a presentation at Princeton.   It is a Blockchain and belief summit and there are four breakout sessions and I’m the featured guy on the third breakout session.   It’s all about community leadership.

You’ll see in this video that I have had some friends over for barbecue through the years.

If any of you have followed me, I have always wanted to have some core developers show up for a bite and I’m happy to say that a couple of them have. They aren’t necessarily represented in this video and I don’t wanna blow up my personal life around the Fire Pit with some of the people that have come by, but you’ll see that a few of them have including Paul Brody.

I’ve also been cooking at Eth Denver for several years and I hope that if any of you go to that conference that maybe you could swing through one of the parties and I could finally get a chance to meet you all

Anyway, this video is going to be presented on Wednesday next week and it is unlisted, but I just want to share ahead of time just for fun.

This community means so much to me.  I’m very humbled and thankful for so many of the relationships that have been built on Reddit.

I know the crowd has moved on quite a bit. A lot of people left to X and Discord and Telegram and beyond.  But I’m still here and you’re still here and I still think we have the best place to learn from.

Cheers and big hugs from Kansas City

t1_nmokr3c,"This is in response to a post yesterday by u/physalisx: https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1olfl2l/daily_general_discussion_november_01_2025/nmlmgvk/. He was asking about a massive spike in blob gas fees last Thursday. I looked into what probably happened. My response got a bit longer than I first intended and maybe some other people are interested in it as well, so I post it in todays daily.

Thanks, I was not aware there was such a massive blob gas fee spike on Thursday afternoon (UTC time). Blobs have a similar pricing mechanics like normal transactions on Ethereum. There is currently a target of 6 blobs per block. If more blobs are posted, the price increases until the rollups stop publishing more than 6 blobs per block and then the blob price goes down again. I looked at the various data from the time of the spike and here is what I think happened. First of all I am not sure that the ultrasound money data is accurate. There definitely was a price increase, but I am not sure it was that huge at that time. I think one reason for my confusion is that some sources state blob gas prices as price per byte of blob space (Etherscan) ~~and other sources state the blob gas prices as price per blob (Ultrasound money)~~ (EDIT: see discussion below. Looks like ultrasound.money just reports gas fees wrongly) . 1 Blob has 128 kiB or 131072 byte ~~, so depending on where you look you can see massive numbers~~ (EDIT: same reason as above. Ultrasound.money is most probably wrong in their numbers). Even though the numbers seem very high, the actual price in dollar terms paid is not that much. I found prices of $0.37 paid for the blob fee alone around that time. This is still less than the price paid for publishing the paid blob on chain, which was around $3.50 around that time.

Now lets look at the spike itself. At the moment we are on average close to the 6 blobs target (5-6.2 blobs on average). It only needs a small increase in blob demand to go over the target and prices start increasing exponentially. On Thursday we had a very volatile time in the market with the ETH price went down about $300 within a few hours. It then partially recovered afterwards. This volatility increases DEFI activity also on rollups which then lead to increased blob demand. According to Hildobby's Dune dashboard there also seems to have been an increased blob demand by a relatively unknown rollup called 'Shape' around the same time. Shape was the second largest blob user for several hours. No idea why Shape had such a demand increase, because I do not see any activity increase on their L2Beat page. Maybe it was just an algorithm of theirs going haywire. I would guess these two factors pushed the blob prices upwards over an extended period which means the blob pricing algorithm went exponentially higher with every block.

In the coming months I do not expect to see such spikes for some time at least. The upcoming Fusaka upgrade on December 3rd will increase the blob target/limit from the current 6/9 to 10/15 and then 14/21 within a few weeks. That more then doubles the blob space. It will take some time to fill that up. And currently core devs are already discussing going to 64/72 within a few months. That would increase the blob space by more than a factor of 10 from today. More than enough space to absorb the spikes. To make sure blobs are not handed out for free, Fusaka introduces EIP-7918 which sets a dynamic minimal price for blobs. The minimum will still be low (around a fraction of a cent I guess), but far away from 1 wei (~ $0.0000000004) which they would be without EIP-7918.

Highest blob carrying transaction I found during that time. I am sure there are slightly higher ones:

t1_nmuei0u,"I hate to say it, but just holding BTC would’ve been a lot less stressful - and probably healthier for many of us. Stress kills, and yeah, people will say that means you invested too much or didn’t manage risk. But realistically, holding ETH over BTC since 2021 has been the wrong move. It’s been painful watching the ratio bleed while putting in the research and conviction.

Don’t get me wrong - Bitcoin has plenty of issues ahead. The block-reward decay, the security budget, and the lack of real development are all still there. But in a twisted way, it might just get away with it. Or maybe we’ll all be twenty years older by the time we’re finally proven right that Bitcoin’s long-term model is cooked.

Bitcoin’s had an easy ride: fewer updates, fewer devs, endless marketing. Meanwhile, Ethereum has to be in the trenches constantly - upgrading, iterating, proving itself through fundamentals and real metrics. It’s exhausting watching the “harder-working” chain keep losing the narrative.

If Tom Lee or any of these market guys want to save face, they’ll have to start buying ETH on the open market and push the price up. Because like it or not, retail comes back when ETH starts moving faster than BTC. That’s what shifts the narrative.

And no - this isn’t a capitulation post. I’m still here, still holding. I just hate that it feels like being right about ETH takes more pain, more patience, and more proof than anything else in this space. Maybe that’s what separates conviction from coping… or maybe I’m just the bottom indicator. 😅",2025-11-03T07:30:22,r/ethereum,Numerous_Ruin_4947,34,comment

November 3, 2025:

**Balancer V2 Suffers $110m Exploit**  
Balancer, a pioneering AMM and originator of the 80/20 weighted pool design, [suffered](https://x.com/Balancer/status/1985390307245244573) a smart contract exploit on November 3, 2025, at 7:48 AM UTC, resulting in over [$110 million](https://x.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1985281156259201044) in assets drained from its V2 Composable Stable Pools and Balancer V2 forks. The hack impacted multiple chains, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, Sonic, and Berachain. The majority of stolen assets consist of WETH and liquid staking tokens (LSTs) like wstETH, osETH, and rETH. Launched in 2021, Balancer V2 introduced a singleton vault for enhanced capital efficiency. The composable design exaggerated the exploit across pools and chains. Balancer V2 underwent multiple audits by OpenZeppelin, Trail of Bits, and Certora. Balancer V3, deployed in December 2024, and non-composable V2 pools remain unaffected. Balancer V2 users should immediately withdraw funds and revoke token approvals.

**Balancer V2 Exploit Response Efforts**    
The Balancer V2 exploit [triggered](https://x.com/hosseeb/status/1985394967712510295) various responses across affected chains and protocols to mitigate impact and freeze stolen funds. Balancer immediately paused all pausable V2 Composable Stable Pools and entered recovery mode, isolating the issue to legacy V2 infrastructure. Berachain coordinated validators for an emergency hard fork, blacklisted attacker addresses, and recovered assets from compromised pools. Sonic [activated](https://x.com/SetteeCh/status/1985323623784054883) a new onchain account freeze mechanism to lock the attacker’s wallet without a hard fork, pausing affected pools. Downstream protocols like Beefy and YieldFi paused V2 integrations. Security teams from PeckShield, Nansen, and BlockSec are tracing funds, with some already blacklisted on exchanges.

*Ant Group's Ethereum-based Jovay aims for 100k transactions per second, potentially transforming global finance infrastructure.*

[*Ant Group*](https://cryptoslate.com/circle-eyes-china-market-alipay-integration-amid-reported-ant-group-partnership/) *is betting that the next leap in digital finance will not happen in a bank but on* [*Ethereum*](https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/)*.*

*On Oct. 14, the Chinese fintech giant behind Alipay’s 1.4 billion-user payment network* [*launched*](https://x.com/JovayNetwork/status/1978068288405225796) *Jovay, a new Layer-2 (L2) blockchain built atop Ethereum to move real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain at institutional scale.*

***What is Jovay?***

*Ant Digital, the blockchain division of Ant Group, describes Jovay as a “compliance-first, AI-assisted scaling network” that aims to integrate real-world data and value flows into decentralized finance.*

*The platform uses dual provers, a zero-knowledge and optimistic hybrid, to ensure both scalability and verifiability. It deliberately launches without a native token, signaling a focus on enterprise and institutional adoption rather than retail speculation.*

*The implications are vast. Alipay has 1.4 billion monthly active users and handles trillions in payment volume annually. If even a fraction of that activity migrates to Ethereum rails through Jovay, the network could become one of global finance’s most consequential infrastructure bridges.*

*According to Jovay’s technical* [*paper*](https://docs.jovay.io/guide/jovay-white-paper#_5-rwa-smart-tokenization-on-jovay)*, the network achieved 15,700 – 22,000 transactions per second (TPS) during testnet trials and targets 100,000 TPS through node clustering and horizontal expansion.*

At some point I'll sure sell some though, to make improvements to real life things, but not before $9.4k, that's bare minimum for a 10% out.

Not sure exactly why I'm writing this today. I used to spend so much time here. Being informed and sharing information felt like a necessity. 

But things are running smoothly in Ethereum lands nowadays, most of the problems we had just 3 years ago feel so distant now. 

Path to scalability? Cleared. Regulations? Doing good! Adoption? Going nicely!

t1_nm0myrk,"You remember the news of yesterday that Western Union would choose Solana to settle the transfers between their desks through a home-made stablecoin?

I wrote that it looked suspicious to me because Solana is unstable (cancelled transactions when the TPS approaches its maximum, hours long outages every second year) and unsustainable (the number of validators (that are centralised around the Foundation) keeps dropping because they are unprofitable (the hardware, bandwidth and electricity cost millions per year while the net yield (counting unlocks) is around –10%/year)).

Today the Ethereum L2 teams gave the explanation for the strange choice of Western Union: Western Union wanted the experimental phase to be financed by the network. Solana offered a bigger check ($50M):

https://x.com/camillionaire_m/status/1983506060343185571

**In 6 months, after the experimental phase, Western Union will be free to use an Ethereum L2.**

Once again, Solana had to buy the appearant relevancy of their shaky product. Reminder:

- SOL DATs have been sold discounted SOL by the foundation, which is basically paying companies to accept to buy SOL,
- dying company Sorare got bribed $10M by the foundation last month to move to Solana,
- Kraken got paid the same way to launch their stocks on Solana before their own Ethereum L2 a few months later,
- Now Western Union is paid by Solana in a new attempt to appear relevant... for 6 months.",2025-10-29T14:51:32,r/ethereum,trillionSdollarstech,53,comment

t1_nk4ehe9,"The most interesting thing about Ethereum and the years to come is how Ethereum is both a rising challenger to the incumbents in TradFi, and at the same time it is an incumbent itself within DeFi/Blockchain.

2024 was revolving about the 3 front tech battle in DeFi/Blockchain. Now that it is apparent Ethereum is coming ahead, the challenge is a 2 front battle in DeFi and TradFi.

Balancing those two and coming ahead both in TradFi and DeFi is the biggest challenge and it's quite literally the only thing I find interesting about the scene lately. Especially considering the distributed nature of the Ethereum ecosystem (private entities, client developing enterprises, EF, Etherealize...), when the only examples of this in history I can think of are enterprises with single and unified governing body.

I struggle to find an equivalent story in the past that maps 1:1 with this scenario.",2025-10-18T10:53:14,r/ethereum,rhythm_of_eth,24,comment

t1_nksk57i,"A few days ago, electric capital published a new developer report for the crypto ecosystem. As far as I know the report is not yet publicly available, but news sites report about it already. As expected Ethereum has the largest active developer share overall and also the majority of new developers flocked to Ethereum. Ethereum has a pretty nice lead and growth overall.

Obviously, Solana does not like to lose in gameable metrics, so the head of developers relation made a large commit to the electric capital github repository to make sure all the solana developers are ""properly"" tracked. They wanted to add 7816 solana repositories. As expected many of these repositories are dead, have nothing to do with Solana or are even Ethereum repositories. I am sure the goal was that Solana devs are are counted properly...

The Solana devrel even wanted to list Nethermind, an Ethereum client, as a Solana repository. Yes, really. 

The electric capital maintainer of the repo filtered through the list and with a minimal filter and suggests to throw out more than a third of the entries. I looked at a handful of projects on that list myself and I have to say it looks like 80% are either non existent, not solana related or not really more than a person copy pasting a tutorial. 

I am not really really surprised by that behavior of the solana devrel, but I am still disappointed that they manage to lower the bar even further.

t1_nknvuhu,"After two years and a bunch of shenanigans, I executed ``rm -rf eth-docker`` and 86'd all of my assigned holesky genesis validators. 

All my Hoodi validators are still chooching though, so I've got that going for me. It's been real. It's been fun. But it ain't been real fun.

There is something quite odd about working through a massive crisis...that...isn't actually one? That's what testnets are for, obviously. You still have this underlying sense of ""we NEED to fix this NOW"", but the overall vibe is muted.

Anyway, I'll take this little post to remind everyone that there is more to do in the ecosystem than just complain or celebrate about the price action (although I do my fair share of chart watching and leverage degen gamboling). 

Get out there, ask how you can contribute. Throw some of your time, or your compute at something and pick up a new skill! My linux-fu is an order of magnitude greater now than it was 2 years ago, and that translates into heaps of other marketable skills not just in our little ecosystem, but the computer science/software industry writ large.

I am looking at a major career change here in the coming weeks and months and I can say that operating these validators, and working through major problems with a small team of other rocketpool nerds, remotely spread out across dozens of time zones gives me credibility in a field I never earned a degree in. And that's cool. It would also be cool if eth could stop fuckin' around and get up to $10k+ so maybe I wouldn't HAVE to change careers.

t1_nkkp5q4,"Trezor just introduced their new hardware wallet called Trezor Safe 7 (https://trezor.io/trezor-safe-7). It has bluetooth which makes it more mobile friendly than the older trezor wallets. It will be available in a month for around $250 or 250 Euro.  

What makes this announcement special though is that Trezor built their own secure element chip. They created a new company called tropico square which developed this chip (https://tropicsquare.com/). This secure element chip is fully auditable by security experts. Interested parties can order samples without having to sign an NDA and then publish their findings openly. To the best of my knowledge, all other secure element chips need you to sign an NDA and if you find security vulnerabilities you are not allowed to talk about them with anyone else. Trezor said they looked through so many secure element chips and found gaping holes in them which they are not allowed to talk about to anyone and the producer did not care. According to Trezor, many of these vulnerable secure element chips are widely used in the hardware wallet market. The most open secure element chips you could get until today were ones which allowed you to open source the code you ran on them, but most do not even allow that. That is why many hardware wallets are at least partially closed source and you have to trust the manufacturer to a large degree to not change the software under the hood without you knowing.

For me, the introduction of this auditable secure element chip is a very positive development. It will take some time until it will have an impact on the market. I personally am still a bit hesitant and will probably wait a year or so until I would load my cold wallet seed phrase on it, just to make sure that possible bugs have been ironed out.",2025-10-21T09:40:39,r/ethereum,haurog,29,comment

t1_nlo1s34,"(Thinking of doing weekly reports/updates - turned out quite long, so very open to feedback)

growthepie Weekly Summary (October 20-26, 2025)  
Last week, the Ethereum Ecosystem demonstrated significant progress in scalability, adoption, and community engagement.

Scalability and Performance Insights

* Recently Ethereum Ecosystem Transaction Per Second: Reached an all-time high of 3,100 TPS, up from 2,835 TPS, driven by Base (1,716 TPS), Arbitrum (1,201 TPS), and other Layer 2 solutions. Projections highlighted in our quick bite article indicate potential growth to over 10,000 TPS on Ethereum mainnet and over 1 million TPS within the Ethereum Ecosystem.
* Analysing the impacts of Base lower gas targets (33% vs. 50%) increased monthly transactions by 20% (300M to 360M), though active addresses decreased from 30M to 16M. DeFi transactions grew, and NFT activity rose, suggesting a shift toward organic user engagement.
* World Chain Active Addresses: Surged to a record 120,000 (+58% daily), fueled by Polymarket’s mini-app launch. We will be updating this metric to include user operations, this figure is currently under-reported.

Adoption Metrics

* Ethereum Stablecoin Supply: Grew to $173 billion, a $5.5 billion weekly increase (+96% year-over-year), with mainnet leading adoption, bolstered by its consistent uptime.
* Starknet Stablecoin Growth: Reached $140 million, a 63% increase in 30 days.
* Superform Transaction Growth: Recorded a 1,000% increase in weekly transactions (10,000) and a 258% rise in active addresses (2,800), primarily on Arbitrum One.
* Robinhood Tokenized Stocks: Tracked 489 stocks with $8 million in onchain value, showing steady inflows and growing interest in real-world assets (RWAs).
* Shopify on Base: Maintained consistent daily volumes via the Commerce Payment Protocol, signaling Web3 integration in e-commerce (search “Shopify” on our platform for details).
* a16z State of Crypto Report: Highlighted crypto’s maturation, faster chains, and DeFi mainstreaming, with our data featured prominently.

Community and Ecosystem Discussions

* Polygon PoS Classification: A community poll showed two-thirds support for including Polygon PoS in the Ethereum ecosystem. Our founder emphasized open dialogue with Polygon, with internal discussions on improving classification. (Noting that on reddit less people were in favour)
* GG24 Interop Round: With less than two days remaining, over $100,000 in matching funds support open standards and infrastructure.
* Octant Epoch 9: Top donors supported projects include ZachXBT and TheRageTech.

Additional Notes

* Jovay Network by Alipay: TPS tracking is live.
* Ethereum Reliability: Maintains 100% uptime (for over a decade) despite outages on AWS.
* Branding Note: Our platform is styled as “growthepie” (lowercase). Access our guide via right-clicking our logo.",2025-10-27T15:54:58,r/ethereum,growthepie_eth,41,comment
t1_nlopmfq,"Solana is having serious issues with their validator set. 

The delegating / staking approach is not working for most of the smaller in scale validators and they have been turning fees to 100% and grifting users just to get by.

Solana representatives go on to declare that ""cutting the fat"" is net positive for the chain, and kicking them (through a Discord message lmao)

Sure, your already heavily centralized validator set is shrinking further, economic viability is no longer there unless SOL does 100% YoY, and apparently centralizing further is the way to go.

This is like the Bitcoin mining competition theory but weirdly applied to PoH/PoS.

Unless SOL pumps like crazy or Solana finds a killer story like pump.fun, I'm pretty sure it's a steady decline from here.

t1_nn7o7e2,"A few weeks ago Lighter, an application specific rollup started on Ethereum. Lighter is a perp DEX, similar to hyperliquid or Aster and the uncountably many perp CEXs. Perpetual exchanges are used by many to leverage (10x-100x) long or short the market. I personally do not touch them because leverage is the easiest way to get flushed out of the market, especially in highly volatile times like now. One can also use them to hedge market risks or lock in current prices for a future sale of locked tokens, but as the 10/10 crash showed one cannot fully not rely on perps to have a delta neutral portfolio. Nevertheless, Lighter is an interesting case for Ethereums modular approach as Lighter is not a full EVM rollup it can do perp dex specific transactions only. That means no overhead, no slow zk proof creation due to the many complex EVM opcodes. Just pure perp DEX action. Lighter also does not publish each individual transaction in Blobs. It just publishes the state changes since the last published blob on Ethereum. This means if someone did a thousand transactions on their account since the last published blob it still means it only needs 1 entry for the state update. That is a very efficient approach. The state diffs approach is something only zk rollups can do and many do that (ZKsync, Starknet, ...). Optimistic rollups need to publish the full transaction data for other people to prove that the current state is correct, but with zk rollups the zk proof already proves that the current state is correct, so zk rollups just have to publish the state diff since the last update. Pretty neat. At the moment Lighter seems to update its state every few minutes on Ethereum. 

In the last few weeks L2Beat evaluated the implementation of Lighter and published their findings yesterday. Lighter only has one red slice in the five risk slices. Everything else is green. It still is a stage 0 rollup though, because the L2Beat team did not yet verify that the open source code for their node is able to reconstruct the current state. If this succeeds they become a stage 1 rollup. And then it is only a question of how they set up their councils for smart contract upgrades so people have a long enough exit window in case of a malicious bridge contract upgrade. The interesting part is that even now, the escape hatch functionality is implemented. That means users can exit their funds in case of proposer failure or front end censorship. Not sure how user friendly this process is though. The front end censorship is an issue on hyperliquid as some users could deposit, but when they wanted to withdraw, their funds where frozen as their wallet was somehow connected to unwanted entities or jurisdictions. 

As lighter is a perp DEX, it naturally has a lot of transactions. Each individual bid and ask price change as each individual change in the orderbook needs a transaction. Most of these are done by bots to provide liquidity and arbitrage the different DEXs and CEXs. That is why on L2Beat the daily activity jumped from a few hundrerds TPS a few weeks ago to 4.5k TPS yesterday. Pretty amazing development in my view. It makes it a bit more difficult to follow the TPS changes of fully EVM compatible rollups though as they are all overshadowed by Lighter. Maybe L2Beat finds a neat way to show EVM compatible rollups and app specific rollups in different colours on the activity chart. 

If you want to know more about Ligher, Bankles has a good interview with the founder (see links below) and I thought it was a pretty honest evaluation how Lighter fared in the 10/10 crash. If you want to know more about L2Beat and their missionm, The Edge podcast has a great interview with Bartek, the L2Beat founder see links below.

So far, things are looking good and we don't see any clients forking off. There is a slight drop in participation but that could be (and very likely is) just some node operators that forgot to update their clients.

I'll update this post once we finalize a couple of epochs.

Edit: We're now two finalized epochs in with a participation rate of about 94-95% (it was about 99% before the upgrade).

The chance is real that we ship Fusaka on mainnet this year! That's two big network upgrades, including the whole Holesky mess, in a single year.",2025-10-28T19:02:59,r/ethereum,eth2353,38,comment

t1_nltjtc7,"Greetings from Buenos Aires!

I have arrived early, thanks to the flexibility of the Ethereum Foundation. I'm exploring the city, of course, but also exploring the opportunities for decentralised and trustless use of crypto in the city.

A few people on Twitter have commented that the need for cash in Buenos Aires has been greatly overstated. I took that mean that I didn't have to worry about carrying cash and I have to say, that has not been my experience at all. I ended up needing to get cash as a matter of urgency:

* The deposit for a towel at the hostel: Cash only.
* First coffee shop I walked into: We do not take cards.
* Subway card: Topping it up can require cash depending on where
* Restaurant for dinner: 15% discount if you pay in cash
* Tips in general: Cash clearly highly preferred

That's not to say you can't pay for many things with card; in fact for my SIM from Claro (specifically for tourists, requires showing a passport), she told me before we started that it was card only.

I was unable to quickly find a means of converting stablecoins to cash through the exchange houses, although it is clear that such places exist. Next step is to try the local apps and see what options there are, although a friend of mine is worried that I seem happy to outsource my survival to apps that crash in dark mode.

I did find one place that was crypto friendly last night: a brightly lit candy shop offering halloween treats and delicious things with a sign on the door: We accept Bitcoin Cash.

I'm now installing a BCH wallet so I can buy some candy and report back. You're welcome.",2025-10-28T12:54:39,r/ethereum,Twelvemeatballs,27,comment

t1_nkxzyln,"I'm as bullish as ever on Ethereum and im not selling until at least 2030 so i can see all this adoption happen and all this tech finally become what we were dreaming about for the last 8+ years.

But me and other people here are losing hope of seeing crazy high prices for ETH.   
And let's break it down instead of just complaining:

In the last 8+ years, remember these sentences?  
-""when institutions will come, we will be rich""  
-""when Ethereum scales successfully with layer2's and the insane fees are gone, massive price gains will happen""   
-""when we start burning ETH with EIP-1559, the price will skyrocket""  
-""when Ethereum transitions to POS, the 99.9% energy consumption drop and green narrative will finally convince the world to buy ETH""    
-""the 90% issuance drop in ETH from moving to POS, aka the triple halvening will create a supply/demand that will make the price of ETH pump like never before""  
-""when Ethereum enables staking, everyone will buy ETH to stake and the price will go parabolic""   
-""if ETH had a Michael saylor, ETH would be double it's ATH easily""  
(ETH treasury companies now own more % of the supply compared to bitcoin treasuries)  
-""if Ethereum had ETF'S, ETH would be doing as well as BTC""  
-""if Ethereum had a spokesperson to teach everyone about Ethereum, the world would buy ETH""    
(we have etherealize now for a while, huge respect to them)    
""-if Ethereum had someone like Michael saylor to talk about Ethereum on tv and podcasts and interviews, ETH would skyrocket""   
(we have tom lee now)    

Let's be real, Ethereum has so much things happen that this list is probably way longer.  
And there will be many more bullish catalysts for Ethereum because Ethereum's fundamentals and upgrades and upcoming tech is so huge and amazing.  
And there are 2 that i can already think of:  
-""when layer2's start paying for blobs, ETH price will go up""  
-""when ETH ETF'S get staking, tradfi will buy ETH at unseen amounts resulting in huge pumps""  

But i just can't help wondering of that huge list of insane bullish stuff happened and the price is under $4000, then are those 2 new things really going to pump ETH? Or will they be added to the list above, things that are insanely bullish but did nothing for the price...

Again, i remain max bullish for Ethereum and im staying to see this play out because tokenization, stablecoins, ai,... Etc. Is all about to explode and the majority is clearly happening on Ethereum. When all the financial giants are publicly announcing their layer2's and saying tokenization and stablecoins are going to take over the financial world, when trillions of dollars go onchain in the upcoming years, and the exchange ETH reserves going down more than any girl I've ever met, the price of ETH must go up right... There is no way it doesn't, and im fucking staying untill then.

So fuck this depressing dogshit for now, it is what it is, Ethereum is winning, mass adoption is on the horizon, our time will come and ETH will be worth at least 5% more than it is now,...   
we just need a bit more of that agonizing, excruciating, torturous, harrowing, unbearable, insufferable and distressful thing called patience.",2025-10-23T12:13:18,r/ethereum,Decentralizedbanana,45,comment

t1_njp6ce6,"Accumulation signals are all positive for the week:

1) We broke 17M exchange reserves on Sept 22. We broke 16M exchange reserves on Oct 8. That's just over 2 weeks later. A week after that we're already at 15.6M so on track to drop another 1M every 2-3 weeks. That's absolutely *wild* amounts of accumulation.

2) $19B in liquidations the other day but only about $700M of ETH ETF outflows. Clearly they aren't driving the drop. On Sept 15th ETFs had 6.7M ETH. Today they have 6.8M ETH. Meanwhile the price has dropped from $4500 to $4000. They're hodling while Web3 natives are noodle handing this. It's really embarrassing.

3) In the same timeframe DATs have acquired another 1.5M ETH. At todays prices that's around $6B of inflows in ~4 weeks. Over $1B a week of hard accumulation from committed never-sellers. $1B a week into an asset with a price elasticity of 10 should mean we're should be coiling up a 2% market cap expansion a week. By that logic if it wasn't for all the eager sellers we should already be 15% above our ATH just given the inflows since then. The spring may just be coiling for the next step function move like we had in July. I certainly hope it happens before EOY.

Everything I can see still says money is flowing into the space and taking ETH in droves off weak handed web3 holders. It's just crazy how much ETH they seem willing to part with given all the hard signs of adoption:

1) YTD stablecoin market cap up almost 50% (~90B). Vast majority of that is on Ethereum. Tron of all things is losing market share. Tether regularly printing billions.

2) We now have 5 companies committed to bringing on tokenized equities. Starting in Sept we are seeing a rocket under the TVL on the already on-chain ones. We've gone from about $80M to $425M in a few short months. Most of these seems to be Ondo rather than Backed or xStocks. This is to say nothing of Robinhood or Blackrock's efforts which are not yet on chain but [sound like they will be substantial](https://youtu.be/-LPit2bEWAo?si=MwvkPfqEGzKHR35J&t=99). Of course the vast majority of TVL and volume is on Ethereum.

Fink: ""I do believe we're at the beginning of the tokenization of all assets from real estate to all equities to bonds - across the board. There $4.1T in money sitting globally in digital wallets.  A lot of that money is outside the United States. If we can tokenize an ETF, digitize it, we could have investors who are just beginning to invest in markets through crypto investing in the more traditional long term retirement products. We look at that as the next wave of opportunity for Blackrock over the next tens of years as we start moving away from traditional financial assets by repotting them in a digital manner and then having people stay in that digital ecosystem.""

Interviewer: ""You weren't always a huge proponent of crypto.""

Fink: ""Yeah but I grow and learn.

3) Speaking of Blackrock the BUIDL fund is up from $650M to $2.8B YTD and we've added a host of other on-chain treasuries from WisdomTree, Franklin, and Fidelity. Again, all Ethereum.

4) Transactions on Ethereum + L2s are up about 50% YTD from 18 to 27M per day.

t1_nk15vef,The most bullish thing for Ethereum is to be understood. Right now Bitmine meets the qualifications for about 1700 index funds that the ETFs otherwise would not qualify for. Those 1700 index funds will have to make a decision on how to rebalance their portfolios. In order to make that decision on Bitmine they will need to try to understand Ethereum. We're going to educate tradfi kicking and screaming if we have to but they can't just ignore us.

To the people who follow this closely, we can see that the vast majority of this is happening on Ethereum, blackrock outright saying why they chose ethereum, Robinhood choosing ethereum, sony L2 filed for a banking license this week to be able to launch stablecoins, alibaba built a layer2,... And so so much more is clearly happening on Ethereum. It seems like everyone is building a layer2 on Ethereum these days. 

joseph chalom even got out of retirement to work at SBET because he as an ex blackrock head of digital assets knows that this shit is about to explode on Ethereum, he knows what's coming. 

And then ofcourse you have these things that Ethereum didn't have in the last bullrun when the price of ETH hit ATH:

-eth etf $27b  
-eth treasuries $23b  
-90% eth issuance drop with pos  
-99.9%. Energy usage drop with pos  
-successful scaling, look at these low fees while usage has gone up   

How the fuck is this asset not trading much much higher? This is so crazy to me lol, i wake up everyday just baffled by this.",2025-10-17T05:42:20,r/ethereum,Decentralizedbanana,26,comment

t1_nnlhe1v,"I've got something to say about some accounts in here real quick.  Listen up.

I've noticed over the last couple of days a TON of accounts coming in here with 100% negative tone on market price action, which to be honest, sucks. I get that.  But they also bring NOTHING to the table about the news surrounding this asset.  

Furthermore nearly 100% of these ""contributors"" has little history here and nearly as many have never made it to the Doots list at all...not even once.

TO BE CLEAR:  I'm calling out the one liner accounts...they come in with one line to say, very few words, and all of it negative.  

So please keep in mind, and I can't confirm this, but on days where we dip and we get 600-1000 comments, I start to get suspicious of social media manipulation to drive narratives.

That's ok for them to do this, but do your work on your end to verify some facts about these accounts.

Here's your tool.  Just open https://dailydoots.com/leaderboard/ and search any of these accounts, you'll see they most all have zero social reputation in the daily general discussion here on /r/ethereum.

Use Reddit Enhancement Suite on  Chrome to take notes and see if you see patterns like me.

t1_no9d6tf,"The TPS metrics that were discussed on CT and in podcasts are imo misunderstood. Yes, TPS is not a perfect metric. Yes, you can't compare Lighter TPS to Solana (or ETH mainnet or zksync etc.). It's like comparing apples and oranges. But imo that's not what this is about. It still shows that Ethereum is scaling, both via general purpose L2s **and** app specific L2s. So saying that TPS don't matter at all is wrong. We can't build perp dexes on L1. But we can build them in the ecosystem now, something which was impossible before. Now the one thing that's missing is (native) interop.

t1_no6cm5d,"Weekly Summary: Ethereum Ecosystem Insights from growthepie (November 3-10, 2025)   
Last week, the Ethereum ecosystem showcased robust scaling advancements, with transaction per second (TPS) reaching new records and Layer 2 solutions driving efficiency. Below is a concise summary of key developments and metrics from our platform   
  
Scalability and Performance Highlights

* Ethereum Ecosystem TPS Record: Achieved an all-time high of 24,192 transactions per second, primarily driven by the layer 2 Lighter with its ZK rollup architecture and state diffs, which minimize data posting to Ethereum blobs (under 100 MB/day compared to Base's \~2 GB/day at 150 TPS). Projections suggest sustained bursts above 10,000 TPS as more chains integrate
* Base Transaction Milestone: Hit a daily all-time high of 15.43 million transactions, reflecting strong user engagement and low fees fostering organic activity
* Layer 2 Weekly Active Addresses: Declined approximately 68% from all-time highs to 5.37 million single-chain users, with 288,000 cross-Layer 1/Layer 2 and 218,000 multi-Layer 2 users. Ethereum Mainnet held steady at 2.28 million, underscoring its reliability

Stablecoin and Adoption Metrics

* Base Stablecoin Supply: Surpassed $4.5 billion, highlighting growing liquidity and DeFi integration on the chain
* Ink Stablecoin Growth: Reached an all-time high of $134.9 million, up 14% in 24 hours and 127% over 30 days, signaling rapid adoption
* Celo Daily Active Addresses: Led all chains with over 709,000 daily active addresses and 1.47 million transactions, driven by microtransactions (76% of activity) and Celo Dollar (296,000 active addresses, \~40% of total)

Key Metrics and Updates

* Robinhood Tokenization Expansion: Added 151 new stocks on Arbitrum, including Monster Beverage, Domino's Pizza, and Hasbro
* Ecosystem Overview Enhancements: Real-time tracking now available for more chains - TPS, fees, and uptime across the Ethereum ecosystem. Search ""Ecosystem"" on growthepie for live updates
* App Revenue and Fundamentals: Ethereum's monthly transaction count hit a record high, with ecosystem revenue consistently near $40-46 million daily, fueled by high throughput and low fees

Community and Ecosystem Discussions

* TPS Metric Debates: Addressed critiques on aggregating L2 TPS, emphasizing it measures the ecosystem's modular scaling—tailored solutions secured by Ethereum's settlement layer. Compared to single-chain approaches, this enables higher collective performance while leveraging some benefits of Ethereum security (varies per scaling solution)
* Chain Listings and Integrations: Ongoing discussions with more chains to be listed soon

t1_nofcny3,"Looks like something insane just happened for staking in the US.

""Treasury and IRS Release Revenue Procedure 2025-31

The new guidance clarifies how staking rewards are treated for crypto trusts and ETPs. Under this framework, staking rewards are no longer treated as immediate taxable income for trusts, allowing crypto ETPs to stake assets and distribute rewards to investors without prior tax complications.

Key Points:

• Scope: Applies to staking within registered crypto ETPs (e.g., Ethereum ETFs).

• Impact: Enables funds to stake holdings and pass yields directly to investors under existing tax-advantaged structures.

• Market Effect: Removes a major regulatory obstacle that previously limited staking adoption in U.S. investment products.""

t1_nofagti,"JPM has officially released its stablecoin on Base L2, another win for ETH and a clear sign of the growing tokenization trend. I wouldn’t be surprised if this creates a frenzy of banks rushing to issue similar stablecoins for their customers.

This is how the tokenization thesis has always beem determined to play out: one company becomes two, then four, eight, sixteen, and so on. It won’t be a gradual process, but an exponential growth curve.

t1_nmclmd8,"Fusaka upgrade is coming to mainnet. In Yesterdays ACD Call it was decided that the upgrade will happen on December 3rd. The first blob increase (BPO1) will happen 6 days later on December 9th and the 2nd blob upgrade (BPO2) will happen on January 7th. 

Currently each block can have a target of 6 and a maximum of 9 blobs. With BPO1 there will be a target/max of 10/15 in each block, with BPO2 it will be 14/21. This means will more than double the blob capacity until January. More space for scaling. Further increases of the blob counts will be decided at a later time. For the moment this is more than enough for some time to come. 

Client releases will come in the next few days. Most plan to release on Monday, as far as I understand, Prysm might be a few days late. Should be more than enough time to upgrade the nodes.

The most important part in this upgrade is PeerDAS which allows for scaling the number of blobs massively, while at the same time reducing the bandwidth and storage requirements for small stakers. There is also a minimum fee for blobs coming and some smaller changes tweaks which also allow scaling Ethereum mainnet. These new clients also push the gas limit to 60M gas on mainnet which is an increase by 33% to what we have now.

t1_nmdpw7j,"I managed my first P2P shopping encounter today! I went back to the La Golosineria, the candy shop with the Bitcoin Cash sticker in the window.   

So at the till, I asked the guy if it was true that you could pay with Bitcoin Cash and he was all yeah, course you can, no problem! But when it came to it, he wasn't really sure what to do. He was trying to generate a QR code, I think, and then asked an older woman for help.   

She had no idea. ""Can't you just pay with MercadoPago?""   

""Yes, but I want to try this."" She gave up on the whole escapade at that point but he was invested and got on the phone to someone, explaining that he had a customer that wanted to pay with Bitcoin Cash and now what?  

He asked me to scan the shop's QR code, with opened a screen confirming who I was about to transact with and asking how much I wanted to transact. I typed in 2,700 ARS and he said wait wait wait, don't send it yet! Then he spoke on the phone some more before confirming that the other person was ready and telling me, ""OK, now send it!""   

I submitted the tx and showed him on my screen that it had gone. He asked the person on the phone ""Did you get it? She sent it!"" And then the answer seems to have been yes, because he gave me my candy and told me all was good.   

My BCH haul:  

* Pipas mini crack fuego  
* Bull Dog regaliz, sabor sandia  
* Spicy honey roasted mani desde el campo

t1_nm5dlcp,"I can't get over how **violent** these candles are, not just on Ethereum but even gold for God sake. It genuinely feels like all assets are a warzone of long v. short and no side really has control in a hugely dominant way.

The four-year-cycle folks feel somewhat vindicated because there's been a sustained pullback that feels a bit like the past, but also it really doesn't - I was there for it. There's way more buy support and *hopefulness* around and it's not as if everyone universally feels like we're at the end of an obvious and massive bubble. No real retail euphoria but aggressive selling that feels like it did in 2021.

I think we're seeing the four-year-cycle crowd listen to their guts and selling as hard as they can while the music is still playing, against a bunch of institutional buyers stepping in to snatch it up before they try and kick off the retail wave. Absolute warzones daily, so much violence on the chart, but I still think the buyers win out as they're the bigger players with deeper pockets and we're seeing mass accumulation before a huge retail sales pitch.

t1_nnt9i0v,"Had a few quality conversations in the last day. A repeating theme and the topic of a debate on stage was what our industry is going to do about treasury yield.

Let's say that yields over the next 30 or so years average 3%. Of course the US would like it lower, but then there's number of factors driving it higher such as lower credit rating of US bonds, a looming national debt of $30T or so, etc. If secretary Bennett and the federal reserve are correct in their forecast, we'll be at something like $3T in stablecoins by 2030. If Tether/Circle get to keep that money that means they have about $90B in revenue annually from the interest stablecoin holders forfeit on their own money. This is how you get valuations for the Tether company at $500B even though the company does basically very little and only has about 150 exployees. This is, to put it mildly, more revenue than all of Defi put together. People are raging about Hyperliquid generating a billion in revenue. The Curve dex generates like $25M a year. At $90B, what happens to this revenue is the biggest question of the next cycle and it will make or break Defi.

The state of play at the moment is that the Genius act has language in it that prevents stablecoin yield from going to stablecoin holders. This wasn't even argued into the bill by Tether, though they are the largest beneficiary. It was actually the primary condition of the bank lobbyists. But, if the goal of regulations are to protect people it's difficult to make any case in which forcing people out of the interest on their own money is protecting them. Either way their money is being subjected to risks by whatever revenue source backs the stablecoin. I haven't a compelling answer to what is the incremental risk of paying a portion of that interest forward to retail. The argument put forth by the banks is the flight of capital from banks would threaten the lending facilities in the US which is not a consumer protectionist argument.

The loophole at the moment, used by Coinbase and others, is that the dividends aren't being paid to retail but rather the revenue goes to the issuer (Circle), which then pays the distributor (Coinbase) a fee, which in turn puts that money into a marketing budget and pays out to a rewards program (Coinbase Earn). Through this channel, end users still receive the interest on their payments. Naturally, the banks are trying to close this loophole with the pending market structure bill.

On the debate, there was consensus amongst the four presenters that paying devs this money and investing it into the ecosystem was both legal and healthy but as long as that remains the argument it seems like it's a hard loophole to close.

Let's assume for the moment that this loophole is protected by Circle lobbyists, how can Defi turn around and strip this revenue from the Circle company and give it to Defi users?

Step 1 of this is to do what Hyperliquid already did. You have a stablecoin issuer like Native form an agreement to create a whitelisted stablecoin like USDH. The pattern for that already worked and this already shifts the revenue from going 100% to the issuer to something like 95-99% to the distributor. Each ecosystem (each L2?, each App?) creates a stablecoin in this way or maybe a major player like Frax fills this role.

For step 2, the distributor forwards the revenue to either the app or to underlying pools of the app. This gives those pools using the ecosystem stablecoin a several percent higher yield.

For step 3, you need a mechanism to vampire attack the existing pools to convert TVL to the ecosystem stablecoin. You don't have to convert every single app at the same time, but as a market maker or lender you can't afford to be in a tiny pool. Basically arbitrage eats the first mover alive so somehow we need to incentivize this risk. There are two things I think we should try here (concurrently).

First, a player like Frax or other large holder of LDRs could just direct an outsized portion of their bribe power to one ecosystem at a time and jack that APR up to the hundreds of percent for pools using the ecosystem stablecoin.

Second, you can execute the Sushiswap playbook. You get LPs of the old pool to deposit to a vampire contract that the LP deposit tokens sit in until a critical threshold of TVL is met after which it all migrates at the same time. This removes the risk of the first mover entirely but there's a fledgling phase here where you're probably paying people in the vampire pool extra yield even though only USDC/USDT is being used there. You really don't want that to last long but it's a viable trick to break the Moloch trap. The missing pieces here are who is going to fund this pool before the vampire attack executes and how do you convert say $1B of ETH/USDC to ETH/FRAX or something atomically.

At the end of this you have a variety of stablecoins. There's probably one for each major exchange (think BUSD reborn) and then one for each coordinating ecosystem (arbUSD, crvUSD, frxUSD, solUSD, USDH, etc). If executed correctly, the value of Tether goes from $500B to like $50B, the market cap of Defi absorbs a good portion of that, and end users of Defi actually get a fairer interest rate. $90B a year, we need to get organizing.",2025-11-08T19:22:17,r/ethereum,LogrisTheBard,37,comment

t1_nnqr19f,"The current situation/ market is strange. People don’t want it to be over cause… well, bags? At the same time it doesn’t look good and some ETH „maxis“ have indeed capitulated already. 

Everything we have learned in the past years is contradicting. 4 years vs QT ends/ rate cuts/ etc. 2x ATH for Bitcoin only and a lot of alts not even hitting ATHs vs 3x-10x ATHs from last cycles. Blow off tops vs no blow off/ euphoria etc at all. 

People are looking for answers and hints (I do as well) and it’s impossible to get good ones. Either it’s cope and you just believe what confirms your bias or you think about capitulation but are scared of missing that „one last leg of the cycle“. 

Bad news, I dont think I can help you either, at least not for the short term. I think the 4 year cycle is dead, but again, maybe I am just coping. 

But on the long run things look great.L1 scaling continues. High fees will come back from time to time (eg on flash crash days like last week) but generally speaking L1 is viable for way more people and portfolios than expected. L2s are scaling. Like really scaling. And I am not talking about the TPS numbers from lighter, those are great as well, I am more referring to zksync, megaeth, et al (to a certain extent base, let’s see if they can zk their chain) and think what we are seeing is more than what we need in terms of infrastructure today. This obviously includes the fork in December. 

I think we basically only need interoperability. The more I think about it the more it’s clear to me that composability + security/ world ledger is everything we need. If people can do stuff „in the eth ecosystem“ without waiting and even knowledge of L2s, because for them it’s one tx (or intend) and it’s confirmed within seconds… then there’s nothing that can stop Ethereum.

So I built ByteBell to fix this for good.

# What it does:

ByteBell implements a state-of-the-art knowledge orchestration architecture that ingests every Ethereum repository, EIP, research papers, technical blog post, and documentation. Our system transforms these into a comprehensive knowledge graph with bidirectional semantic relationships between implementations, specifications, and discussions. When you ask a question, ByteBell delivers precise answers with exact file paths, line numbers, commit hashes, and EIP references—all validated through a sophisticated verification pipeline that ensures <2% hallucinations.

# Under the hood:

Unlike conventional ChatGPT wrappers, ByteBell employs a proprietary multi-agent architecture inspired by recent advances in Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG). Our system features:

1. **Dynamic Knowledge Subgraph Generation**: When you ask a question, specialized indexer agents identify relevant knowledge nodes across the entire Ethereum ecosystem, constructing a query-specific semantic network rather than simple keyword matching.
2. **Multi-stage Verification Pipeline**: Dedicated verification agents cross-validate every statement against multiple authoritative sources, confirming that each response element appears in multiple locations for triangulation before being accepted.
3. **Context Graph Pruning**: We've developed custom algorithms that recognize and eliminate contextually irrelevant information to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio, preventing the knowledge dilution problems plaguing traditional RAG systems.
4. **Temporal Code Understanding**: ByteBell tracks changes across all Ethereum implementations through time, understanding how functions have evolved across hard forks and protocol upgrades—differentiating between legacy, current, and testnet implementations.

# Example:

Ask ""How does EIP-4844 blob verification work?"" and you get the exact implementation in all execution clients, links to the specification, core dev discussions that influenced design decisions, and code examples from projects using blobs—all with precise line-by-line citations and references.

# Try it yourself:

[ethereum.bytebell.ai](http://ethereum.bytebell.ai)

I deployed it for free for the Ethereum ecosystem because honestly, we all waste too much time hunting through GitHub repos and outdated Stack Overflow threads. The ZK ecosystem already has one at [zcash.bytebell.ai](http://zcash.bytebell.ai), where developers report saving 5+ hours per week.

# Technical differentiation:

This isn't a simple AI chatbot—it's a specialized architecture designed specifically for technical knowledge domains. Every answer is backed by real sources with commit-level precision. ByteBell understands version differences, tracks changes across hard forks, and knows which EIPs are active on mainnet versus testnets.

# Works everywhere:

Web interface, Chrome extension, website widget, and integrates directly into Cursor and Claude Desktop \[MCP\] for seamless development workflows.

# The cutting edge:

The other ecosystems are moving fast on developer experience. Polkadot just funded this through a Web3 Foundation grant. Base and Optimism teams are exploring implementation. Ethereum should have the best developer tooling, Please reach out to use if you are in Ethrem foundation. DMs are open or reach to on twitter [https://x.com/deus\_machinea](https://x.com/deus_machinea)

# Anti-hallucination technology:

We've achieved <2% hallucination rates (compared to 45%+ in general LLMs) through our multi-agent verification architecture. Each response must pass through multiple parallel validation pipelines:

1. **Source Retrieval**: Specialized agents extract relevant code snippets and documentation
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Dedicated agents analyze metadata for versioning and compatibility
3. **Context Window Management**: Agents continuously prune retrieved information to prevent context rot
4. **Source Verification**: Validation agents confirm that each cited source actually exists and contains the referenced information
5. **Consistency Check**: Cross-referencing agents ensure all sources align before generating a response

This approach costs significantly more than standard LLM implementations, but delivers unmatched accuracy in technical domains. While big companies focus on growth and ""good enough"" results, we've optimized for precision first, building a system developers can actually trust for mission-critical work.

Anyway, go try it. Break it if you can. Tell me what's missing. This is for the community, so feedback actually matters. [ethereum.bytebell.ai](http://ethereum.bytebell.ai)

Please try it. The models have actually become really good at following prompts as compared to one year back when we were working on Local AI [https://github.com/ByteBell](https://github.com/ByteBell). We made all that code open sourced and written in Rust as well as Python but had to abandon it because access to Apple M machines with more than 16 GB of RAM was rare and smaller models under 32B are not so good at generating answers and their quantized versions are even less accurate.

Everybody is writing code using Cursor, Windsurf, and OpenAI. You can't stop them. Humans are bound to use the shortest possible path to money; it's human nature.  
Imagine these developers now have to understand how blockchain works, how cryptography works, how Solidity works, how EVM works, how transactions work, how gas prices work, how zk works, read about 500+ blogs and 80+ blogs by Vitalik, how Rust or Go works to edit code of EVM, and how different standards work.  
We have just automated all this. We are adding the functionality to generate tutorials on the fly.

We are also working on generating the full detailed map of GitHub repositories. This will make a huge difference.

**If someonw has told you that ""Multi agents framework with Customised Prompts and SLMs/LLMs"" will not work, Please read these papers.**

**Early MAS research**: Multi-agent systems emerged as a distinct field of AI research in the 1980s and 1990s, with works like Gerhard Weiss's 1999 book, Multiagent Systems, A Modern Approach to Distributed Artificial Intelligence. This research established that complex problems could be solved by multiple, interacting agents.   
**The Condorcet Jury Theorem**: This classic theoretical result in social choice theory demonstrates that if each participant has a better-than-random chance of being correct, a majority vote among them will result in near-perfect accuracy as the number of participants grows. It provides a mathematical basis for why aggregating multiple agents' answers can improve the overall result.   
  
**An Age old method to get the best results, If you go to Kaggle majority of them use Ensemble method. Ensemble learning:** In machine learning, ensemble methods have long used the principle of aggregating the predictions of multiple models to achieve a more accurate final prediction. A 2025 Medium article by Hardik Rathod describes ""demonstration ensembling,"" where multiple few-shot prompts with different examples are used to aggregate responses.

**The Autogen paper:** The open-source framework AutoGen, developed by Microsoft, has been used in many papers and demonstrations of multi-agent collaboration. The paper AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation Framework (2023) is a core text describing the architecture. 

**Improving LLM Reasoning with Multi-Agent Tree-of-Thought and Thought Validation (2024)**: This paper proposes a multi-agent reasoning framework that integrates the Tree-of-Thought (ToT) strategy. It uses multiple ""Reasoner"" agents that explore different reasoning paths in parallel. A separate ""Thought Validator"" agent then validates these paths, and a consensus-based voting mechanism is used to determine the final answer, leading to increased reliability.   
  
**Anthropic's multi-agent research system:** In a 2025 engineering blog post, Anthropic detailed its internal multi-agent research system. The system uses a ""LeadResearcher"" agent to create specialized sub-agents for different aspects of a query, which then work in parallel to gather information.",2025-10-24T21:18:25,r/ethereum,graphicaldot,128,post

This is a topic that is not given much focus by leaders in ""blockchain"", although Gavin Wood has increasingly talked about it in the last couple of years and made it a priority to migrate Polkadot to ""one person, one unit of stake"", what I call ""proof-of-suffrage"". To me, it is inevitable, and a logical next step, that every country in the world starts to run such a system. For traditional national IDs to be secure on-chain, the newer generation ""digital ID"" is needed where the personal data is held by the individual and proofs are generated with ""trapdoors"" and such (so they cannot be leaked) and possibly things like ""zero knowledge proofs"" to prove ""is over 18"" (I do not understand how those works but it seems like it could apply there). Such are starting to make their way into national ID systems and Bhutan is (I assume) using that technology. This all seems like something that people all over the world could unite around, both people in a presumed ""crypto community"" and then also all other people who are part of the ""nation state community"" or ""international community"". A very good thing is that once a very good standard for ""proof-of-suffrage blockchain"" has been produced, every country can use that (incl. Bhutan...) but it can also be used with alternative national ID systems such as video pseudonym parties from 2015/2018.",2025-10-15T15:34:36,r/ethereum,johanngr,43,post

t3_1o8a3i9,"AMA: I made a feature documentary on The DAO, smart contract exploits, and the hackers who say they broke no laws **I’m James Craig, one of the directors of new documentary** ***Code is Law*** **- the true story of the smart contract hacks that challenged what counts as a crime. AMA!**

[Trailer for Code is Law](https://reddit.com/link/1o8a3i9/video/jfhgvq04xhvf1/player)

Hey everyone - I’m James, a UK-based investigative journalist and first-time indie filmmaker. I’ve spent the past two years alongside my fellow director Louis Giles making *Code is Law*, a feature-length documentary about some of the most infamous exploits in Ethereum’s history.

The film explores a wave of massive smart contract hacks where attackers stole millions — and then claimed it was all perfectly legal. Starting with **The DAO**, it traces a lineage of exploits including **Indexed Finance**, **KyberSwap**, and **Mango Markets**, where the phrase “*code is law*” went from meme to courtroom defence. 

We speak to the developers, investigators, and white hats who lived through these events - including the hunt for **Andean Medjedovic**, a teenage math prodigy who stole **$65 million** and became the first hacker to claim “code is law”. Medjedovic is now a **fugitive from FBI charges** who has been on the run for almost five years. 

The film also covers the case of Avraham Eisenberg, whose $110 million Mango Markets exploit became the first courtroom test of the 'code is law' defence - and set a legal precedent with global implications.

t1_nmdl02v,"If you want the real honest answer, it's because the thinking is that dApps are going to replace everything when in reality they won't. Blockchains vs Centralized databases are a tradeoff between performance and counter party risk. Blockchains were invented to deal with the issue regarding property rights in a digital world. However people want performance and usability, and if a centralized database solves that problem more efficiently than a blockchain, then people are going to stick with the centralized database.

dApps have their use, especially when it comes to digital property rights, acting as a neutral layer for internet payments, etc. However just creating a dApp for the sake of the dApp doesn't solve anything. There needs to be a value add (like reducing friction or counter party risk, gaining agency or property rights, or transparency) for the dApp to gain traction. This is the reason why stablecoins, specifically regarding access to the US dollar has exploded, as accessing and transacting with the US dollar through traditional finance has been very difficult especially outside of the US.",2025-10-31T14:32:44,r/ethereum,DepartedQuantity,7,comment
t1_nmdtq90,"A few things that I've seen in the last 6m-ish being immersed in a community (in gaming) that is targeting both existing crypto users and onboarding new users. In my opinion:

\- There's currently no incentive to build a sustainable business because building gambling services / moonshots (perps, memecoin launchpads, new ""revolutionary"" L1s, etc) generates far more money in the short term (either through revenue or VC or pump-n-dump). Software is expensive to build - so sound startup decision-making leads you towards building whatever brings in money in the short term. The result of this is that anyone building crypto projects tend towards building these types of projects.

\- A large number of very vocal people have a pretty big hatred of crypto as a whole. They view it as a den of scammers and thieves. This impacts the reach of dapps to successfully build products for normal people.

\- The businesses that crypto-native alternatives would be most likely to disrupt are pretty good at what they do - or they have massive network effects which is hard to disrupt without being 10x better.

\- Smart contract hack risk.

\- Bad marketing (most of the target audience for dapps do not actually care if you have a ""permission-less"" *anything*, so stop marketing that as a differentiating feature).

\- Onboarding *still* sucks - though it's much, much better than it was 1-2 years ago with things like L2s, seedless onboarding, EIP-7702 and user ops, onboard direct-to-L2, etc. For devs - this is pretty difficult to actually implement since there's lots of complexity inherent and knowledge requirements to get into this. There are various decent-ish options to onboard people to crypto but they all come with trade-offs (example: Coinbase onramp = fee-less onboarding to USDC, but then you're stuck building on top of USDC and the cognitive burden of migrating your users away will be a risk to your business in the future).

\- Hesitance towards crypto for tax complexity reasons (especially amongst Europeans). No user of Steam (as an example of a marketplace for digital goods) is worried about the burden of filing taxes associated with buying video games. Because there's no way to bypass that issue with crypto - non-crypto-native users are rightly hesitant about maintaining a crypto balance of any type for any reason.",2025-10-31T15:16:36,r/ethereum,blurpesec,4,comment

t3_1ougrnj,"Ledger moves away from ""hardware wallet"" misnomer to the more appropriate ""signer"" terminology **Hardware wallet is a misnomer**

For a decade, Ledger, Trezor, and similar companies have been calling their devices that sign for crypto transactions and signature requests as ""hardware wallets"".

This was a misnomer because the devices don't store any value in them and don't provide a view of an account/wallet. They just sign with a private key. Unlike software wallets, they often don't provide a front-end app for visualizing an account's assets.

**Ledger has recently taken the first step [to start calling them ""signers"" instead of ""wallets""](https://www.ledger.com/academy/topics/ledgersolutions/from-hardware-wallet-to-signer-a-new-era-for-digital-ownership).**

It may take many years for the crypto community to stop calling these ""hardware wallets"". And maybe the community won't ever stop using the ""hardware wallet"" term, but at least starting to make laymen aware of these devices as being digital signers is a step in the right direction.

---------

**Using ""Cold Wallet"" to refer to hardware signers is an even worse misnomer.**

Back before 2015 and these hardware devices became popular, ""cold wallet"" meant ""cold storage"". Exchanges had a ""hot wallet"" for daily transfers and a ""cold wallet"" for long term storage. At some point, the term got hijacked by laymen to be synonymous with ""hardware wallet"" even though they're very different things. Many hardware wallets are used to sign transactions for daily-use accounts that should be called ""hot wallets"".

And that created confusion over 2 sets of differing terminology.

In recent years, Ledger has avoided the term ""cold wallet"", but other companies like Trezor continue to misuse it.",2025-11-11T18:10:36,r/ethereum,HSuke,22,post

I wrote a breakdown that walks step-by-step through:

* How the 4-byte function selector is derived from the function signature
* How arguments are ABI-encoded into 32-byte slots
* How the EVM matches that selector to the correct function
* What the compiled bytecode looks like under the hood
* What happens when the transaction runs through the EVM

It includes real calldata examples, decoded transactions, and bytecode snippets from a simple Solidity contract.

t1_nkohpa1,"Nice write-up. I agree that you can't solve this problem without either trust or a blockchain unless you give up the ability to do key rotation. (I think the latter is how they do it in nostr, just make key rotation a non-feature and tell your users not to lose the key that controls their identity...)

On this part:

> The most scalable way to do key rotation/revocation trustlessly is to just anchor batches of off-chain data on a blockchain (which is the approach we took with Ceramic Network), however it's not optimal since it's vulnerable to the Late publishing attack described see Sidetree spec. Only by publishing key rotation/revocations directly on-chain do you get guaranteed finality of your operations.

For identity do we care about the Late Publishing Attack? It's the user's own identity, if they want to make weird forks of it that show up when nobody expects them isn't that up to them?

Or is the issue just that you might already be compromised and not know it, ie if someone hacked my account on day 1 I'm hacked whether I like it or not but I'd rather the attacker had to show their hand right away?

FWIW I wrote up a variant of DID:PLC that tries to use as little blockchain as possible:

Inspired by [Rune’s “Case for Clean Money,”](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/q1cyj9/the_case_for_clean_money_a_new_vision_for_makerdao/) we took a fork of r/MakerDAO and replaced the collateral with climate-impact RWAs like carbon credits, green bonds, and renewable energy debt. Azos is live on Base and $AZUSD can be borrowed.

some additional background:  I bought my first ETH back in 2017 while working at Lyft on the driver growth team that beat Uber to IPO. In 2019 I joined ConsenSys, and after getting laid off (good times), I went to ETHDenver 2020 looking for my next role.

t3_1ou3anv,"How to deploy Ethereum rollups without losing your mind Been building on Ethereum for a while now and something clicked recently. Remember when spinning up your own rollup meant assembling a whole infrastructure team and spending months just getting things working? Feels like that era is basically over.

Tried setting up a custom L2 for a DeFi project last month and the whole experience was shockingly smooth. Used Caldera and had a testnet running in like an afternoon. No joke, just clicked through some options, picked Arbitrum Nitro as the framework, and boom.

The wild part is how much flexibility you get now. Can switch between Optimism, Arbitrum, even zkSync stacks without rebuilding everything. Makes me wonder why anyone's still maintaining custom rollup infrastructure from scratch when tools like this exist.

Granted, there's still a learning curve with gas optimization and bridging logic, but the actual deployment pain is mostly gone. Curious if other devs are seeing the same shift or if I just got lucky with my setup.",2025-11-11T07:32:34,r/ethereum,Acrobatic-Arugula-96,15,post

t3_1od6wyy,"Switzerland's First Blockchain-Integrated Bank Implements ERC-2535 Diamonds Stobox recently launched a regulated security token offering (STO) for Monerys AG — and it’s powered by the **EIP-2535 Diamond Standard**.

According to their announcement, the Stobox 4 tokenization platform’s **STV3 Protocol Architecture** is built on Diamonds, giving it modular and upgradeable smart contracts. This allows the security token’s logic (compliance rules, jurisdictional requirements, governance modules, etc.) to evolve without redeploying the token contract.

Why this matters:

* **Regulatory flexibility** – facets can be upgraded to meet changing legal requirements.
* **Stability** – the token address stays the same, aiding audits and investor trust.
* **Reusability** – the platform can support multiple offerings using shared contract modules.

This is one of the first public examples of **Diamonds used in a regulated STO**, showcasing how EIP-2535 can support real-world asset tokenization and long-term contract maintenance.

​Transaction count and gas usage are both trending higher again.

​Staking deposits also ticked up over the past few days.
​To me, this looks like more than just a “speculative bounce.”

t3_1odcg29,"Building a privacy-friendly subscription system for Web3 users (no KYC, no emails) — looking for alternatives to Stripe Hey all,

I’m working on a Web3 tool that uses a **tiered subscription model** (monthly access, different feature sets per tier). The catch:

* Our audience are **privacy-first Web3 users**, so we **don’t want to collect emails** or any personal info.
* We also **can’t really use Stripe**, since that involves traditional KYC and fiat rails.
* Each user might **connect multiple wallets** under the same subscription tier.

I’m trying to figure out the cleanest way to implement this kind of setup.

Some early thoughts:

* Using **smart contracts** for subscription tiers (maybe via ERC-721 or ERC-1155 “membership NFTs”).
* Payment in **stablecoins** (USDC, DAI, etc.) or native gas tokens (ETH, MATIC, etc.).
* Maybe integrate something like **Superfluid** for streaming payments, or **Unlock Protocol** for token-gated access.
* Managing multiple wallets per user without a centralized identity layer is tricky — possibly link wallets via signed messages or ENS text records?

Has anyone tackled a **non-custodial, privacy-respecting subscription** model before?  
What tools or protocols would you recommend as “Web3-native Stripe alternatives”?
