p_1odhyzv,"26yo Building a long-term DCA crypto portfolio (advice appreciated) Hey everyone, This is my first year investing. Iâ€™ve been learning a lot through stocks and ETFs, but recently I started building a long-term crypto portfolio alongside my traditional investments. My plan is to hold solid projects for 10â€“15 years and keep a consistent DCA approach instead of trying to time the market. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m currently DCAâ€™ing into each week: BTC â€“ $25 ETH â€“ $12 SOL â€“ $10 LINK â€“ $10 XRP â€“ $7 AERO â€“ $12 TAO â€“ $12 Iâ€™m mainly focused on projects I think have long-term potential â€” things like AI, interoperability, and scalable ecosystems. Iâ€™m not trying to chase hype coins, just build steady exposure to what might still be relevant in 2035+. Would love feedback from the community: â€¢ Does this seem like a balanced long-term mix? â€¢ Anything youâ€™d replace or add? â€¢ Any underrated projects worth researching for a 10-year hold?",2025-10-22 20:28:32,Practical_Movie_5887,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit,0

p_1oe3ya2,"Bitcoin Beyond Money: The Philosophy of Digital Sovereignty. **By MoBitSo** Money used to have weight. Thatâ€™s right, it was metallic, cold, and heavy, stamped by kings and trusted merchants who placed more trust in the crownâ€™s face than in the man beside him. Later, it also became paper, promises printed by governments and traded for goods, for labor, and in exchange for time. **Then it comes with screens.** It turns out that money becomes numbers. Invisible but one finds it everywhere. We would not touch our wealth simply sees it appear and vanish at glowing rectangles. It usually felt comforting, but something was lost deeply in translation-the sense of having ownership with what was actually ours. Then the phrase â€œownershipâ€ becomes just a polite illusion, banks keep your money; governments watch your transactions, and corporations define your digital identity. There is access but no authority. Thereâ€™s permission but no power. Then, very quietly, in 2009, a pseudonym signed a manifesto. The prophet was Satoshi Nakamoto, the prophet who released a few pages of code and a radical idea: a financial system that needs no kings, no banks, no middlemen. A world where truth would be verified not by institutions but by consensus. Bitcoin was then born not as a product but as a rebellion, a protest against the architecture of control. **But mostly, they did not notice it.** The charts, the speculative frenzy: they were hubbed about price on the greener pastures, treating Bitcoin as a stock or at least as a shortcut to get rich. But to those gawking scholars, Bitcoin revealed something altogether deeper-it was a philosophical machine disguised as money. It is not that bitcoin is made for making you rich; it is made for making you sovereign. To possess your wealth is to possess your will. To move it freely is to move your voice. To verify it yourself is to own your truth. Bitcoin didnâ€™t just reinvent currency; it redefined what it means to be an individual in a digital world. However, in traditional economies, trust flows up. We trust banks to keep our savings safe, central authorities to ensure the fragility remaining intact, and governments and their codes to protect our rights. History is not short of recurring lessons reminding us about painful lessons that power once concentrated doesnâ€™t remember whom it serves. **And that flow is reversed by Bitcoin.** It converts trust into verification, authority into protocol, and hierarchy into visibility. The blockchain doesnâ€™t press for faith-it gives proof, each block a testament, each transaction a declaration that the truth can exist without permission. **This is the silent revolution many still miss out on.** Bitcoin is not just a monument or technological breakthrough but also one philosophical breakthrough. It embodies that very simple but dangerous thought: define how your freedom will be determined, not by the institution but by the individual. Holding your private keys is like holding a digital equivalent of Lockeâ€™s natural rights-liberty encoded, property encrypted, consent expressed as a cryptographic signature. Political philosophy becomes software in the form of Bitcoin. Thus, itâ€™s like calling something money as too small to be narrowed down that way. It is not the next version of finance; it is the first version of digital selving. It registers a huge change in human organization; as much as the invention of written law or the printing press, tools that not only change what humans do but what they are. As we enter deeper into an era of surveillance capitalism, progammable currencies, and money, Bitcoin makes more and more sense; it is a mirror that reflects the tension between convenience and freedom, between the comfort of control and the courage of autonomy. What Bitcoin is doesnâ€™t basically make it flawless. What is required is onus. What it punishes is forgetfulness. What it doesnâ€™t provide is refunds and what isnâ€™t acceptable is excuses. All that is precisely the philosophy: freedom with accountability, sovereignty with consequence. We are accustomed to systems that save us from our errors, but these also lock and limit themselves from our independence. Bitcoin invites us to grow up: to become stewards of our own digital lives. **The future will become not who holds the networks but who holds the keys.**",2025-10-23 14:56:53,mobitso,post,bitcoin,,Reddit,1

And I've heard it said there's ways to go from proof of work to proof of stake, if that were desired. I don't know how that actually happens. Who agrees with change in the model and how does this protocol change get pushed out? Here's a few challenges bitcoin has to deal with eventually. 1. There's a rate limit on the number of transactions. So either the number of transactions per epoch or the rate of epochs needs to go up by hundreds of fold to be similar to say Visa. In particular workarounds like lightning network evidently have a model flaw in that it becomes unviable as bitcoin transitions from mining based to fee based. 2. Moving to quantum resistant signatures. 3. Reducing the cost of mining without losing the security model of cost based (paid in energy) Mining.

p_1oe43xd,"Payments 101: Why Polygon is built for money, crypto payments, and onchain finance At Polygon, we have a clear vision: to make Polygon the leading global payments and settlement infrastructure in crypto. tl;dr: * The best money rails are onchain, on Polygon * Stable, near-instant, and low-cost, Polygon is the infrastructure payment service providers need to thrive * Polygon is so easy to build on that many consumers that use popular apps like Polymarket donâ€™t even know theyâ€™re on Polygon * The network is scaling to meet surging demand Your money today is stuck in line at the bank. Sending it across borders means paying high fees and waiting days for settlementâ€”plus the feeling that you have to rely on a string of intermediaries who profit off your hard work. Now imagine the process without banks, without delays, without enormous fees. Thatâ€™s the promise of onchain paymentsâ€”and Polygon is delivering. Send and receive money as easily as a DM. For the past fifteen years, blockchains have promised peerâ€‘toâ€‘peer finance. But only recently, with a series of payments-focused upgrades for Polygon, has infrastructure matured enough to make realâ€‘time payments feel like the internet. Stablecoin volumes on Polygon in Q3 hit all time highs, at $3.4B, and volume was up to 287M, a 21% quarter over quarter increase. Institutions and startups alike are betting big on crypto and integrating on Polygon, including Stripe, Revolut, Nexo, Reliance Jio, and BlindPay. And then thereâ€™s Polymarket, the first real breakout crypto app. Built and grown on Polygon, Polymarket alone has seen nearly $20B in predictions volume, is the official prediction market for X, and just raised $2B in funding. All of this indicates something true: there is real momentum for onchain payments and digitally-native money more broadly. This trend has people wondering: Why payments, why now, and whatâ€™s next? # Why payments? Traditional payment rails werenâ€™t built for a digital, global economy. Legacy systems batch transactions, rely on closed ledgers, and charge fees that seem invisible until you need to send money across borders. Worse, settlement can take days, meaning funds remain â€œin transitâ€ and tied up in capitalâ€‘inefficient float. For individuals sending remittances or merchants trying to manage cash flow, these frictions are a barrier to true global scale. Onchain payments on Polygon solve this. Stablecoins like USDC and USDT0 represent oneâ€‘forâ€‘one claims on fiat currency and settle on instantly and irreversibly. When you pay someone on Polygon, the transaction finalizes in seconds and costs fractions of a penny. There are no intermediary banks and no cutâ€‘off times. * **For businesses**, this means lower operational costs, better margins, immediate liquidity, and programmable financial flows. **â€** * **For consumers**, it means owning your money and moving it freely. Polygonâ€™s ecosystem has grown into one of the largest stablecoin hubs because it combines high throughput with low fees. Recent upgrades bring the network new dimensions of speed, lightness, and reliabilityâ€”everything you need in a chain focused on payments and programmable money. With this foundation, payments on Polygon feel less like a cassette player and more like a streaming platform. # Why now? As Polygon scaled Ethereum, it became a natural gateway for onchain financial activity. From payments to predictions, Polygon cemented itself as the money rails bringing the next era of digital-native finance. And core developers leaned in. Bringing the world global payments means a network that is: * Light * Fast * Low-cost, and * Easy to build on Every upgrade to Polygon in the last year is a step to doubling down on these qualities longterm so that as demand scales, so does the infrastructure to meet it. The Rio upgrade transforms Polygon into a faster, lighter, and more resilient network built for payments at scale. With a new block production model, Polygon can now reach up to 5,000 transactions per second, delivering near-instant finality and eliminating the risk of reorgs entirely. Validators benefit from stateless validation, which makes running lightweight nodes easier and lowers the barrier to entry for securing the network. As payments integrations across Polygon continue to grow, Rio only accelerates the trendâ€”pushing the network closer to its vision of real-time, global money movement. Every upgrade is important to meet surging adoption. The network supports major institutional integrations from Stripe, Polymarket, Reliance Jio, BlindPay, and many others. \\ For builders and users, the combination of high throughput, low fees, gasless UX and fiveâ€‘second finality means thereâ€™s never been a better time to build on or use Polygon for payments. # What's next? Polygonâ€™s ambition doesnâ€™t stop at 5k TPS and near-instant finality. Polygonâ€™s gigagas roadmap lays out a vision to scale to 100k TPS. Achieving that scale requires rethinking block production and validation, which is why the recent Rio Payments upgrade is such a pivotal moment. Rio introduced a Validatorâ€‘Elected Block Producer (VEBloP) model and stateless block validation. Together, these changes boost throughput, eliminate reorgs, and make finality nearâ€‘instant. In other words, Rio makes Polygon faster, lighter and more reliable. Not in some distant future, but right now. Looking ahead, the combination of Rio, more seamless interop, and the broader gigagas roadmap paves the way for programmable money and realâ€‘world asset (RWA) tokenization at global scale. With instant finality and ultraâ€‘high throughput, institutions can settle tokenized Treasury bills or equities as quickly as buying a coffee. AI agents can initiate micropayments on behalf of users, and crossâ€‘chain transactions can occur without liquidity fragmentation. Polygonâ€™s upgrades create the financial infrastructure that an AIâ€‘powered and digital economy will depend on.",2025-10-23 15:03:00,0xpolygonlabs,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit,1

p_1ocdl0l,What is the likely real case use of major crypto or Bitcoin? Iâ€™m going to preface by saying- I actually admittedly donâ€™t understand a lot of the tech behind many of the currencies. But what do you see as the most likely case in 10-20 years of coins being used or Bitcoin itself? Just a store of wealth or more? Iâ€™ve held crypto for a number of years (mostly BTC/ETH) but find myself often numb to continual articles about ups and down in the market daily - sort of feel itâ€™s not healthy to watch that - I have stocks and donâ€™t watch them every day or week either. I find the arguments of fiat bad and it going to be replaced by crypto or itâ€™s going to replace it a little cultish. My money in the bank (UK) is 99.9% unlikely to drop 20-50% in value in an hour or 24 hours or longer. My money is pretty safe (not that thereâ€™s much of it) and backed by the government should the bank fail - again a very big if and very rare occurrence. I can send money with my banks for free within a few seconds: internationally it would incur an exchange fee but I donâ€™t use that anyway and the fee is sort of minimal really depending on the amount. The rise of ridiculous meme coins and scams is detrimental to seeing any adoption I feel and certainly off putting to people wanting to get involved - and you need security for that to become common. I have funds on exchanges because itâ€™s the most accessible and for me easiest way - and if say for 99% of people if you want a general person to great involved thatâ€™s the best way then a cold wallet which security wise makes sense but isnâ€™t as user friendly as a exchange. I see it as an investment and feel most other people and companies do too as do other people my age I know. I donâ€™t know anyone in offline who sees it as a currency replacement say and I see some tiny places taking payment for a coffee with BTC online but I think thatâ€™s just a waste of it considering fees and such but hey ho. Is it more the tech being behind adapted by banks thatâ€™s happening and due moreso than the coins themselves? I think itâ€™s more likely we get a national digital currency then say the UK adopting BTC - they need to be in control of it for obvious reasons..

When something has already jumped so high in a year, itâ€™s not the moment to average in, I see it as the time to think about locking in gains. And when the economy is in a downturn and the Fed tightens up, piling into high-risk assets makes little sense. A careful investor knows when to hold back. Itâ€™s not about being anti-crypto or anything else. But about knowing when to protect what I have earned. Right now iâ€™m even thinking of having some stock exposure or liquidity as survival, because i still need to deal with rent, food, and fuel costs, and the extras that come with it if traded in the right uex can help. Constantly averaging in during uncertain times can drain someone before the real opportunity even appears. So adding some stock even if it's in my bitget portfolio can still show a way for the two. I know Bitcoin will have its time again, but recovery might take years, much like what happened after the dot-com crash. This phase could be cleansing, pushing out the hollow projects and leaving only whatâ€™s real. But donâ€™t rely on old market patterns; this cycle is different, shaped by broader macro forces. The turnaround will come when the stock market steadies, and that could still be a long wait. Keep watching the market with patience, not pressure.

p_1obw9wt,"What is the best wrapper for PAXG? I have to admit, I'm kind of a fan of PAXG. PAXG if you don't know is an ERC-20 coin soft-pegged to gold. I've held it for quite a while as my long term flight to safety when not actively trading. That kind of worked out in my favor recently. I'm glad I wasn't trading. I'll tell you what I don't like about it. Pretty expensive to move around. We are talking like $3. Now in the grand scheme of things that's tiny. But what I mean by this is I wish it wasn't just a decent value store. I wish it was transactable. Now this is where I'm going to date how up to date my knowledge is. Not very. I nerded out on crypto quite a while ago and then didn't keep up. Hence the question. In theory there are wrappers that could make it transactable. Probably more wrappers than an old hat like me could keep track of. The question is what would actually be good? I know polygon, solana, and avalanche are used to wrap things. No matter what is picked there can be more that one route to actual funding. One could do a bridge that would incur the high paxg fees at least. One could exchange it on a dex. But then you have to find a dex that has decent activity for what is fairly obscure. I would argue it shouldn't be. I wish wrapped PAXG was a common coin. That's why it's worth asking the new hats. I probably sound like I know more than I do. I'm a technical dude but with the last few years of crypto I've mostly just kept up with vocab. That's a pretty shallow level of understanding. I'm confident in my technical abilities enough to admit when my understanding is shallow in an area. I do think gold is going to keep going up long term. And the demand for exchange in gold is going to go up even faster than that. The perceived future demand for gold based transaction is leading the price. I also think that crypto is about to hit another period of significant volatility, more so than recent. In what direction I don't know, but I fear it might be down. More institutions that need to exchange real value are having to do it more often as they are being confronted with the real-politik of the current era. We are now in an era of massive transition. We think AI is causing a lot of transition in our lives but these transitions aren't isolated to us. Some of the most core institutions are finding themselves in fast moving times compared to what they are used to. Their standard rate of change is usually akin to molasses or pitch. We have fiat currencies coming out of existence, like the Argentine peso, and CBDC being attempted, BRICS trying to be a thing, state sponsored resource competition to get the hardware setup for AI, and proxy conflicts between major powers. And these institutions need to exchange real value when they make changes at the lowest level. Just like we can exchange on-chain and off-chain, institutions have on-chain and off-chain. And they have more demand to do more on-chain activity than they have in the past or think that they may need to do on-chain activity in the near future. And on-chain for them is gold. Meanwhile on the consumer end, with attempts to create CBDC, many are going to want to prefer solutions they own to do the same thing. People are going to want to do fast and convenient crypto. And they are going to want to do it with more stability with something people recognize as having value and governments and institutions recognize as having value being a bonus. And as mentioned before governments and institutions will very much be recognizing gold. An era of gold may be upon us, if we want it. If we can only get the transactability working smooth. So let's figure it out. Let's figure out what we are doing and what the standard is to move gold from phone to phone as fast as possible with the lowest fees. The more of us that know what that standard is the more of us can do it and lead that standard. This can be a good foot wedged in door alternative to CBDC. And if we move fast and get that food in the door quickly we can keep the world crypto and free instead of CBDC and controlled. It also may be harder for government to fight it economically if it exchanges something they themselves need to recognize. So back to the technical side. What is the best way for us to do this?",2025-10-20 23:44:31,eccsoheccsseven,post,cryptocurrency,,Reddit,1

In other words, can the credentials trivially be leaked, as there is no ""trapdoor"" or such (as this requires the government key being the one that authenticates, and if user authenticates that part has to be sacrificed but the benefit is the government is no longer notified each time ID is used)? **Edit:** According to Claude AI it seems BBS+ is what solves this problem, and lets the signed credentials still be proven only relative the party verified against, such that they cannot leak the credentials. **Edit:** It now seems the Bhutan ID does not have that property, and that it would require ""designated verifier signatures"". Anyone who is an expert on how Bhutan national ID works or the standard it is based on (W3C?) feel free to explain. **Update:** It seems the Bhutan national ID is not private as proofs can be leaked (and in cybersecurity they should be considered public, anything that can leak will leak).

Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¾ I wanted to share something exciting â€” my youtube channel â€œ90 Seconds to Cryptoâ€ was accepted into the Privacy Round of Gitcoin Grants 24! For anyone unfamiliar, Gitcoin is a public goods funding protocol built on Ethereum. Itâ€™s where open-source builders, researchers, educators, and creators can receive community funding through mechanisms like quadratic funding â€” where 100 people donating $1 matters more than 1 person donating $100. What makes this round special is that the Privacy Round is using MACI (Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) and Privote, a private, zk-proof-based voting system that ensures every vote is tamper-proof, private, and verifiable â€” making this round a real experiment in testing zk-based voting that could one day power even bigger digital democracies. My channel focuses on values-driven, principles-led crypto education â€” shining light on projects building real-world utility and privacy tech (think Railgun, Fileverse, Fluidkey, etc). If that resonates, you can support my work through Gitcoin here: [ Every donation, even $1, helps massively thanks to quadratic funding â€” and all proceeds go directly to keeping the channel going and spreading the good word on good work in crypto. I also made a video breaking all this down â€” from Gitcoinâ€™s funding model to how MACI works: ðŸŽ¥ [ Would love any thoughts or feedback from the community â€” especially from those experimenting with zk tech, onchain governance, or past Gitcoin rounds.

p_1ocn5nc,"Solana tooling has quietly gotten really good Been building/testing on Solana for a while now, and it's wild how much the developer and user experience has improved compared to 2021-2022. Remember when interacting with Solana dApps meant: * Phantom constantly disconnecting * Transactions timing out 50% of the time * Zero visibility into what's happening on-chain Now? Multi-chain tools are actually treating Solana as a first-class citizen, not an afterthought. Example: was testing Banana Pro recently for on-chain automation. It's cross-chain (ETH + SOL), but the Solana implementation is genuinely smoother than the EVM side. Fast confirmations, minimal friction, no bridge nonsense. The fact that you can now build UIs on Solana that feel like... normal web apps (not ""please approve 5 transactions and pray"") is a huge shift.

p_1odpw3s,"How To Make Solana Great Again? # How to Make Solana Great Again? This article aims to establish a targeted developmental strategy â€“ the ""SOL Focus Strategy"" â€“ under the grand narrative of ICM, covering areas from tokenomic model optimization to secondary ecological development. The north star goal of this strategy is to enhance SOL's value capture capability, thereby incentivizing ecological growth and aligning with the grand narrative of ICM. # 1. Tokenomic Model Adjustment Solana's current excessively high inflation rate has hindered ecological development, which is precisely why SIMD0228 was proposed. Therefore, adjusting Solana's inflation rate is imperative. But what should the specific adjusted rate be? We can first define several soft conditions to determine the final inflation rate and staking rewards: â‘  A 2% terminal inflation rate is appropriate. The U.S. Federal Reserve also endorses this standard: in 2020, it explicitly incorporated the ""Average Inflation Targeting"" framework into its policy system. While it allows short-term inflation to slightly exceed 2% to offset periods of below-target inflation, it maintains 2% as the long-term core anchor, believing this level is most conducive to sustaining stable tokenomic growth. This logic equally applies to the long-term stable development of the Solana ecosystem. â‘¡ SOL should avoid deflation. While SOL deflation may seem to drive price appreciation, we must recognize that Solana, as a high-performance blockchain infrastructure, should derive its value growth primarily from its own ecological development and performance improvements â€“ not deflation. SOL deflation would reduce holders' willingness to deploy SOL in ecological use cases (such as staking, DeFi, and NFT transactions), which would suppress ecological vitality and innovation. Thus, deflation for SOL is undesirable. â‘¢ SOL's staking yield should exceed the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds. RWA (Real-World Assets) is a current hot trend and will be a key development direction in the future. It also serves as a critical narrative pillar aligned with the ICM strategy, as it will bring massive liquidity to the entire crypto industry and introduce products with real-world risk-free rates of return (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds). Consequently, the Solana ecosystem will inevitably integrate RWA products related to U.S. Treasury bonds. SOL's staking yield represents the native risk-free rate of return within the Solana ecosystem, and it will inevitably compete with RWA products. Given that U.S. Treasury bonds carry lower risk than Solana staking, SOL's staking yield must exceed that of U.S. Treasury bonds to remain competitive. Since the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds is approximately 4%, SOL's staking yield should ideally surpass this level. â‘£ Should SOL earmark a portion of inflationary funds for long-term development? (This requires further consideration.) Would it enhance the attractiveness of the Solana ecosystem if a fixed percentage of the annual inflation rate were set aside as a dedicated treasury, with funds targeted allocated to long-term ecological development and reserved for contingency use? For details on how this treasury should be utilized, please refer to Section 3 below. # Conclusion: Based on the above soft conditions and Solana's foundational context, we can design an initial inflation rate of 3% for SOL: * 0.5% of this rate will be permanently directed to a treasury, ensuring a stable revenue stream for ecological development. * The remaining 2.5% will be used to reward staking participants. Currently, Solana's staking ratio stands at 65% â€“ a relatively high level. After the inflation adjustment, some stakers will be incentivized to unstake and redeploy SOL into the ecosystem to pursue higher returns. If the staking ratio stabilizes at 50%, validators can expect an approximate 5% yield, slightly exceeding the yield of U.S. Treasury bonds. This will maintain the healthy operation and attractiveness of the ecosystem. # 2. Stablecoin Strategy Solana needs a SOL-collateralized stablecoin. # Rationale: At present, the relationship between many public chains and their ecosystems exhibits a zero-sum dynamic. For example, projects like [Pump.Fun]( require SOL as the participation asset for their business model, allowing them to accumulate large amounts of SOL. However, when these projects realize profits, they often sell off SOL to strengthen their own operations â€“ which restricts SOL's inherent growth. Secondly, SOL's price volatility directly impacts the development of many projects within the Solana ecosystem. The prosperity of the ecosystem is highly correlated with SOL's price, which contradicts real-world pricing mechanisms. In traditional public companies, business operations (fiat-settled supply and demand systems) and stock markets (equity value systems) are inherently isolated: entity operations determine stock performance, but stock price fluctuations do not directly affect daily operations. For instance, even amid a stock market crisis, Luckin Coffee was able to maintain revenue growth through proactive business operations. However, the single-token system in the crypto world breaks this isolation: a single token simultaneously serves as the primary medium for the network's commercial scenarios (e.g., gas fees, entry tickets for application participation) and as an investment asset in the capital market. This creates a risky ""double helix effect"": when the token price rises, market sentiment fuels false ecological prosperity; when the price plummets, developers' incomes decline sharply, leading to difficulties in project operation and maintenance. This is analogous to a project facing operational disruptions solely due to a sharp drop in its token price â€“ a scenario that defies common sense yet is prevalent in the current crypto market. Therefore, ensuring that project operations are driven by supply-demand dynamics (rather than capital market fluctuations) is a critical challenge for Solana and the broader crypto market. Replacing the tokens used in commercial scenarios with stablecoins could address both issues mentioned above: * If Solana's ecological applications widely adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins, cashing out these stablecoins would significantly reduce selling pressure on SOL. * Meanwhile, SOL's price would no longer disrupt normal business operations, avoiding the double helix effect. Once a large number of applications adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins for commercial use, a drop in SOL's price will not severely impact their operations. In turn, the stable operation of these ecological projects will provide support for the prices of both SOL and their own tokens. This strategy will also lock up significant amounts of SOL within such stablecoin applications and spawn derivative applications similar to Curve. Additionally, large-scale stablecoin adoption can integrate with the payment ecosystem: an officially launched Solana Payment App could first support SOL-collateralized stablecoins, followed by USDT/USDC and other mainstream stablecoins. Furthermore, the ICM strategy includes not only pure financial applications but also scenarios where traditional businesses are implemented via Web3. Such projects typically use stablecoins or fiat currencies (e.g., USD) for transactions. If Solana officially launches a SOL-collateralized stablecoin and establishes a dedicated entity to handle off-chain USD-to-on-chain stablecoin exchanges, it will attract more traditional businesses to Web3-ize their operations on Solana â€“ further enriching the ecosystem. Most importantly, this stablecoin need not rely solely on SOL as collateral; it can also accept additional assets (e.g., ICM-related assets) as collateral. This would provide a use case for the large capital pools in ICM, enhance the stablecoin's utility by generating additional interest, and attract more users to adopt or hold it â€“ accelerating the development of Solana's stablecoin ecosystem. # 3. Sustainable Development of SOL In the real world, a common economic stimulus method involves: 1. Collecting tax revenue into a treasury; 2. Distributing a portion of the treasury as consumption vouchers to encourage spending; 3. Generating new tax revenue through the commercial activities driven by this spending. This creates a cycle that enables targeted stimulation of desired sectors while ensuring sustainable tokenomic development. The same logic applies to public chains. Many public chains achieve cold start by launching incentive programs, collaborating with applications to attract users. Early users can earn both public chain rewards and application-specific incentives â€“ a win-win scenario. However, many public chains lack sustainable incentive plans and token value capture mechanisms, leading to insufficient funds for long-term ecological incentives and hindering their long-term growth. Thus, Solana's development requires a long-term incentive mechanism to achieve sustainability â€“ which is why Section 1 proposes earmarking a portion of inflationary funds for a treasury. # Specific Uses of the Treasury: The treasury's 0.5% share of the inflation rate will be allocated to five key areas (the exact percentage for each area can be further deliberated, but establishing such a treasury is essential for providing sustained, direction-driven support to Solana): â‘  Regular incentives (e.g., quarterly) for users of applications with high TVL and transaction frequency. This is a long-term, permanent incentive direction aimed at increasing long-term SOL lock-up and driving more transaction-based burns â€“ ultimately enhancing SOL's value capture from the ecosystem. â‘¡ Periodic incentives for specific sectors: For example, one quarter may prioritize incentives for AI application projects, while the next quarter may focus on high-potential sectors like RWA. This mirrors government-specific funds, which provide targeted support for key industries. â‘¢ Targeted support for projects adopting SOL-collateralized stablecoins: Airdrops will be provided to users of projects with higher stablecoin adoption rates. â‘£ Targeted support for ICM-aligned projects: Funding will be directed to projects that align with the ICM strategy. â‘¤ Development regulatory reserves: These funds will be locked in the treasury long-term and only deployed when the staking ratio is insufficient. Their purpose is to incentivize more participants to stake, ensuring Solana's network security. # Fine-Tuning the Burn Mechanism Currently, Solana's burn mechanism operates as follows: * 50% of base fees are burned, and 50% are distributed to validators; * 100% of priority fees are distributed to validators. This mechanism only burns approximately 0.3% of SOL's total supply, making it impossible to achieve the ideal 2% terminal inflation rate. Priority fees can be viewed as excess returns generated by Solana's network prosperity â€“ and these returns should be aligned with SOL's value. This alignment would tightly bind network prosperity to SOL's value capture. For these reasons, we propose revising the priority fee distribution to (The specific ratio can be further discussed.): * 70% to validators, * 20% burned, * 10% reverted to the treasury. This adjustment will enable the treasury to benefit from ecological growth, creating a positive ""recovery-expenditure-recovery"" cycle. It will also enhance SOL's value capture from the ecosystem and, when combined with the treasury's regular incentives, accelerate burns and value capture â€“ ultimately helping achieve the 2% terminal inflation rate target. # 4. The Necessity and Strategic Significance of Solana's Official Applications The launch of official applications by public chains will become an inevitable trend, driven by three key factors: # â‘  Public chains need to control core applications Core applications play a crucial role in empowering the public chain's token and ensuring ecological stability. If core applications encounter issues, they can disrupt the development of other ecological projects. Thus, managing these applications in-house (by the public chain team) is optimal. For example, Aerodrome â€“ the DEX on Base â€“ was co-launched by the Base team and Velodrome, an established DeFi team. Revenue from Aerodrome can be reinvested to support the Base team's operations. Even if Aerodrome faces issues, the public chain team can provide backup support. In contrast, third-party teams may struggle to recover from hacks or even execute rug pulls â€“ resulting in significant ecological losses. Examples of such core applications include DEXs, over-collateralized stablecoin projects, and Curve-like protocols. These are all suitable for Solana to develop as official, native applications. # â‘¡ Public chains need to ensure core applications empower the native token (which is $SOL, not third-party tokens) Ecological applications on public chains employ diverse business models and tokenomic mechanisms. Some accumulate large amounts of the public chain's token and lock in profits by selling it (e.g., Pump.Fun), creating selling pressure on SOL. If Solana officially launches an application with the same functionality as [Pump.Fun]( it can accumulate large amounts of SOL and manage it in ways that minimize ecological impact. For instance: * The revenue could be reinvested into over-collateralized stablecoin protocols to generate stablecoins, with profits used for ecological development; * Users could be required to use SOL-collateralized stablecoins to participate in the application. Such designs would not only reduce negative ecological impacts but also increase demand for SOL and accelerate its value capture. A relevant case is Virtuals Protocol, which mandates that users use Virtual tokens to participate in its token launches. Additionally, newly issued tokens must form trading pairs with Virtual tokens to be traded. While this design partially stems from Base's lack of a native token, similar models are gaining traction on public chains with native tokens. Traditionally, new tokens would form trading pairs with the public chain's native token â€“ a standard practice. However, designs like Virtuals' have led many projects to mandate trading pairs with their own tokens instead. This means value that would have been captured by the public chain's token is now siphoned off by third-party application tokens. To counter this trend, public chain projects must directly compete for ecological empowerment. # â‘¢ Competitive pressure from other public chains An increasing number of ""public chain infrastructure + official applications"" combinations are emerging. The competitive edge derived solely from blockchain technology or ecological empowerment is diminishing; many projects are seeking ways to secure sustained external capital support for their blockchains â€“ with exchange empowerment being the most effective and direct method. Some projects originated as applications and later expanded into public chains to develop their ecosystems. For example, HyperLiquid first launched a permissioned chain-based on-chain contract application, then built an EVM chain to grow its ecosystem â€“ following a ""trading + public chain ecosystem"" logic. This model is being adopted widely: for instance, payment giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm are jointly incubating Tempo, a new blockchain project built specifically for stablecoin payments, which will likely follow a ""payment + public chain ecosystem"" logic. Additionally, Base Chain and BNBChain are typical examples of ""exchange giant + public chain ecosystem"" combinations, both leveraging CEXs to empower their public chains. These models share a common trait: public chains are no longer satisfied with growth driven solely by on-chain applications. Instead, they are integrating off-chain cash flow-generating businesses with their ecosystems â€“ importing additional positive external resources. In the past, Solana's ecosystem was empowered by the FTX exchange, but no such external positive resources currently exist to continuously inject vitality into Solana. Collaborating with another exchange could lead to uncontrollable risks (like the FTX incident). Thus, Solana must build its own positive external empowerment. # Specific Actions Required: Solana needs to build a permissioned chain to host an official on-chain exchange (including spot and futures trading â€“ a long-term goal). The rationale for developing this in-house (rather than assembling third-party projects) is that third-party projects cannot be built around SOL's value capture â€“ they issue their own tokens and design business models to empower those tokens instead. Solana must expand its value capture from ""infrastructure only"" to ""infrastructure + official application suite."" Revenue generated by official applications should be continuously reinvested into Solana's development, creating efficient synergy. A permissioned chain is necessary (rather than building directly on Solana's mainnet) because only permissioned chains can deliver performance and user experience comparable to CEXs â€“ a key advantage of HyperLiquid. Furthermore, HyperLiquid's growing success demonstrates that on-chain contract and spot trading will be a key growth market in the future. This market will not be dominated by a single player; new competitors will inevitably emerge. Solana should enter this space early to compete. Solana's mainnet already hosts substantial capital, users, and projects â€“ an official Solana-based HyperLiquid equivalent could reactivate the ecosystem, similar to how Coinbase empowers Base and Binance empowers BNBChain. Solana needs cash flow-generating applications to provide sustained external positive support for SOL â€“ and it can even develop features that outperform HyperLiquid. For example, traditional institutions' core concerns about entering ICM are ""compliance and security""; an official permissioned chain exchange could address these concerns through ""regulatory alignment + custody guarantees,"" serving as an ""institutional gateway"" to ICM. This permissioned chain could be co-developed with Solana Layer2 Stack projects (e.g., HyperGrid or Other Layer 2 infrastructure teams, such as Altlayer), or built independently by Solana via its own Layer2 Stack. Developing a Layer2 Stack is critical for the broader ICM narrative, as traditional enterprises and investors typically enter on-chain tokenomic development through two paths: 1. Building applications directly on a public chain; 2. Launching their own managed and controlled Layer2s, then building application ecosystems on these Layer2s. The latter path is preferred not only for faster speeds and lower fees but also for ""sovereignty"": enterprises can directly control the Layer2's development and avoid disruptions from other Layer1 applications (e.g., Layer1 performance degradation or short-term gas fee surges caused by a popular application). Additionally, Layer2s enable the development of broader application ecosystems (not just single applications) and capture value from these applications. This explains why Robinhood plans to launch a Layer2 and Stripe is developing a Layer1 â€“ sovereign application chains will be a potential future trend, and Solana's Layer2 Stack can fully enable this narrative. Moreover, Solana's Layer2 can support both SVM and EVM, with potential liquidity interoperability between the two. This will attract projects that require EVM-compatibility but demand lower fees and higher performance â€“ potentially making the migration of Ethereum ecosystems to Solana a new trend. (Solana's growth potential should revolve around the SOL token and its overall network, not exclusively around SVM.) With an official Layer2 Stack, more application scenarios can be migrated to Layer2: for example, a dedicated chain for Solana's DePIN projects or a specialized chain for payment scenarios â€“ reducing the mainnet's load. Expanding further, Solana could also develop an official bridge to connect these Layer2s; the revenue from this bridge could be reinvested to enhance SOL's value. However, it is important to note that Layer2 may reduce value capture from fees in the short term. Thus, the highest priority in the early stages should be completing the official permissioned chain (via Layer2 Stack) to launch a Solana-based HyperLiquid equivalent. # Summary These strategies are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. They will: * Introduce new types of applications to enrich Solana's ecosystem; * Provide diverse value capture mechanisms for SOL, ensuring it correctly captures value from the ecosystem; * Lay a solid foundation for the effective implementation of the ICM strategy (ICM requires a low-inflation environment to encourage the development of new ICM-aligned applications, and a stable ecosystem will attract more traditional capital to participate in Solana); * Prepare Solana for future competition, as an increasing number of chains are leveraging exchanges (CEX/DEX/PERP) for empowerment. Note: The strategic insights presented in this article reflect the author's current views. If given the opportunity to communicate in depth and gain a better understanding of Solana's future plans, the author is capable of developing more aligned strategies, facilitating their implementation, and validating the author's vision for Web3 development. # AfterWord Recently, the BNBChain ecosystem has seen a surge in momentum, and ecosystem activity has experienced a resurgence. While many may view this recent upswing of BNB as merely a short-lived boom, the actual situation is that the industry will develop along two paths: 1. The first path involves the continuous emergence of new hot topics that drive market sentiment, leading to numerous pump-and-dump activities. However, this path will undoubtedly present opportunities for substantial gains, attracting capital, users, and development teams to explore more efficient products and tools around it. 2. The second path focuses on more fundamental inherent needs that better drive industry development, such as directions like RWA (Real-World Assets), AI (Artificial Intelligence), and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). For public chains, DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), and CEXs (Centralized Exchanges), the optimal approach is to actively embrace both paths. Therefore, Solana can, to a certain extent, draw lessons from BNBChainâ€™s experience in the first path while exploring the second path based on its own unique advantages. This article represents some reflections on the second path. Of course, the strategy mentioned in this article is only the first step; once this first step is truly taken, there will be a second-phase strategy. I hope to have the opportunity to share more about it in the future. # Answers to Some Questions **Q: Is this approach too centralized?** A: For a public chain, technology can be decentralized, but operationally, a central guiding force is needed to steer its development. Otherwise, it may well be eliminated in the fierce competition. Therefore, a certain degree of centralized operation is acceptable. **Q: Regarding the revised data mentioned in the article, are there more appropriate data points available?** A: The data is definitely not final and requires further discussion, but the overall operational logic is relatively certain. The development pattern of the industry will most likely make public chains, DEXs, and CEXs competitors to one another. Hence, it is necessary to make preparations and plans early. **Q: The article mentions many applications, such as stablecoin protocols, for which there are already existing projects. Why is there still a need for the official team to develop one?** A: SOL-based stablecoin protocols will be among the most important DeFi financial infrastructures and are closely tied to SOL. They need to be overseen by the official team. Because if it were a third-party protocol, the development of that protocol would be aimed at its own growth and would not prioritize the impact on SOL. In contrast, if developed by the official team, the economic flows within it can drive capital repurchases and redistribution for SOL.",2025-10-23 01:59:00,Glittering-Parsley38,post,solana,,Reddit,0

p_1odpu77,"How to Make Solana Great Againï¼Ÿ # How to Make Solana Great Again? This article aims to establish a targeted developmental strategy â€“ the ""SOL Focus Strategy"" â€“ under the grand narrative of ICM, covering areas from tokenomic model optimization to secondary ecological development. The north star goal of this strategy is to enhance SOL's value capture capability, thereby incentivizing ecological growth and aligning with the grand narrative of ICM. # 1. Tokenomic Model Adjustment Solana's current excessively high inflation rate has hindered ecological development, which is precisely why SIMD0228 was proposed. Therefore, adjusting Solana's inflation rate is imperative. But what should the specific adjusted rate be? We can first define several soft conditions to determine the final inflation rate and staking rewards: â‘  A 2% terminal inflation rate is appropriate. The U.S. Federal Reserve also endorses this standard: in 2020, it explicitly incorporated the ""Average Inflation Targeting"" framework into its policy system. While it allows short-term inflation to slightly exceed 2% to offset periods of below-target inflation, it maintains 2% as the long-term core anchor, believing this level is most conducive to sustaining stable tokenomic growth. This logic equally applies to the long-term stable development of the Solana ecosystem. â‘¡ SOL should avoid deflation. While SOL deflation may seem to drive price appreciation, we must recognize that Solana, as a high-performance blockchain infrastructure, should derive its value growth primarily from its own ecological development and performance improvements â€“ not deflation. SOL deflation would reduce holders' willingness to deploy SOL in ecological use cases (such as staking, DeFi, and NFT transactions), which would suppress ecological vitality and innovation. Thus, deflation for SOL is undesirable. â‘¢ SOL's staking yield should exceed the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds. RWA (Real-World Assets) is a current hot trend and will be a key development direction in the future. It also serves as a critical narrative pillar aligned with the ICM strategy, as it will bring massive liquidity to the entire crypto industry and introduce products with real-world risk-free rates of return (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds). Consequently, the Solana ecosystem will inevitably integrate RWA products related to U.S. Treasury bonds. SOL's staking yield represents the native risk-free rate of return within the Solana ecosystem, and it will inevitably compete with RWA products. Given that U.S. Treasury bonds carry lower risk than Solana staking, SOL's staking yield must exceed that of U.S. Treasury bonds to remain competitive. Since the average yield of U.S. Treasury bonds is approximately 4%, SOL's staking yield should ideally surpass this level. â‘£ Should SOL earmark a portion of inflationary funds for long-term development? (This requires further consideration.) Would it enhance the attractiveness of the Solana ecosystem if a fixed percentage of the annual inflation rate were set aside as a dedicated treasury, with funds targeted allocated to long-term ecological development and reserved for contingency use? For details on how this treasury should be utilized, please refer to Section 3 below. # Conclusion: Based on the above soft conditions and Solana's foundational context, we can design an initial inflation rate of 3% for SOL: * 0.5% of this rate will be permanently directed to a treasury, ensuring a stable revenue stream for ecological development. * The remaining 2.5% will be used to reward staking participants. Currently, Solana's staking ratio stands at 65% â€“ a relatively high level. After the inflation adjustment, some stakers will be incentivized to unstake and redeploy SOL into the ecosystem to pursue higher returns. If the staking ratio stabilizes at 50%, validators can expect an approximate 5% yield, slightly exceeding the yield of U.S. Treasury bonds. This will maintain the healthy operation and attractiveness of the ecosystem. # 2. Stablecoin Strategy Solana needs a SOL-collateralized stablecoin. # Rationale: At present, the relationship between many public chains and their ecosystems exhibits a zero-sum dynamic. For example, projects like [Pump.Fun]( require SOL as the participation asset for their business model, allowing them to accumulate large amounts of SOL. However, when these projects realize profits, they often sell off SOL to strengthen their own operations â€“ which restricts SOL's inherent growth. Secondly, SOL's price volatility directly impacts the development of many projects within the Solana ecosystem. The prosperity of the ecosystem is highly correlated with SOL's price, which contradicts real-world pricing mechanisms. In traditional public companies, business operations (fiat-settled supply and demand systems) and stock markets (equity value systems) are inherently isolated: entity operations determine stock performance, but stock price fluctuations do not directly affect daily operations. For instance, even amid a stock market crisis, Luckin Coffee was able to maintain revenue growth through proactive business operations. However, the single-token system in the crypto world breaks this isolation: a single token simultaneously serves as the primary medium for the network's commercial scenarios (e.g., gas fees, entry tickets for application participation) and as an investment asset in the capital market. This creates a risky ""double helix effect"": when the token price rises, market sentiment fuels false ecological prosperity; when the price plummets, developers' incomes decline sharply, leading to difficulties in project operation and maintenance. This is analogous to a project facing operational disruptions solely due to a sharp drop in its token price â€“ a scenario that defies common sense yet is prevalent in the current crypto market. Therefore, ensuring that project operations are driven by supply-demand dynamics (rather than capital market fluctuations) is a critical challenge for Solana and the broader crypto market. Replacing the tokens used in commercial scenarios with stablecoins could address both issues mentioned above: * If Solana's ecological applications widely adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins, cashing out these stablecoins would significantly reduce selling pressure on SOL. * Meanwhile, SOL's price would no longer disrupt normal business operations, avoiding the double helix effect. Once a large number of applications adopt SOL-collateralized stablecoins for commercial use, a drop in SOL's price will not severely impact their operations. In turn, the stable operation of these ecological projects will provide support for the prices of both SOL and their own tokens. This strategy will also lock up significant amounts of SOL within such stablecoin applications and spawn derivative applications similar to Curve. Additionally, large-scale stablecoin adoption can integrate with the payment ecosystem: an officially launched Solana Payment App could first support SOL-collateralized stablecoins, followed by USDT/USDC and other mainstream stablecoins. Furthermore, the ICM strategy includes not only pure financial applications but also scenarios where traditional businesses are implemented via Web3. Such projects typically use stablecoins or fiat currencies (e.g., USD) for transactions. If Solana officially launches a SOL-collateralized stablecoin and establishes a dedicated entity to handle off-chain USD-to-on-chain stablecoin exchanges, it will attract more traditional businesses to Web3-ize their operations on Solana â€“ further enriching the ecosystem. Most importantly, this stablecoin need not rely solely on SOL as collateral; it can also accept additional assets (e.g., ICM-related assets) as collateral. This would provide a use case for the large capital pools in ICM, enhance the stablecoin's utility by generating additional interest, and attract more users to adopt or hold it â€“ accelerating the development of Solana's stablecoin ecosystem. # 3. Sustainable Development of SOL In the real world, a common economic stimulus method involves: 1. Collecting tax revenue into a treasury; 2. Distributing a portion of the treasury as consumption vouchers to encourage spending; 3. Generating new tax revenue through the commercial activities driven by this spending. This creates a cycle that enables targeted stimulation of desired sectors while ensuring sustainable tokenomic development. The same logic applies to public chains. Many public chains achieve cold start by launching incentive programs, collaborating with applications to attract users. Early users can earn both public chain rewards and application-specific incentives â€“ a win-win scenario. However, many public chains lack sustainable incentive plans and token value capture mechanisms, leading to insufficient funds for long-term ecological incentives and hindering their long-term growth. Thus, Solana's development requires a long-term incentive mechanism to achieve sustainability â€“ which is why Section 1 proposes earmarking a portion of inflationary funds for a treasury. # Specific Uses of the Treasury: The treasury's 0.5% share of the inflation rate will be allocated to five key areas (the exact percentage for each area can be further deliberated, but establishing such a treasury is essential for providing sustained, direction-driven support to Solana): â‘  Regular incentives (e.g., quarterly) for users of applications with high TVL and transaction frequency. This is a long-term, permanent incentive direction aimed at increasing long-term SOL lock-up and driving more transaction-based burns â€“ ultimately enhancing SOL's value capture from the ecosystem. â‘¡ Periodic incentives for specific sectors: For example, one quarter may prioritize incentives for AI application projects, while the next quarter may focus on high-potential sectors like RWA. This mirrors government-specific funds, which provide targeted support for key industries. â‘¢ Targeted support for projects adopting SOL-collateralized stablecoins: Airdrops will be provided to users of projects with higher stablecoin adoption rates. â‘£ Targeted support for ICM-aligned projects: Funding will be directed to projects that align with the ICM strategy. â‘¤ Development regulatory reserves: These funds will be locked in the treasury long-term and only deployed when the staking ratio is insufficient. Their purpose is to incentivize more participants to stake, ensuring Solana's network security. # Fine-Tuning the Burn Mechanism Currently, Solana's burn mechanism operates as follows: * 50% of base fees are burned, and 50% are distributed to validators; * 100% of priority fees are distributed to validators. This mechanism only burns approximately 0.3% of SOL's total supply, making it impossible to achieve the ideal 2% terminal inflation rate. Priority fees can be viewed as excess returns generated by Solana's network prosperity â€“ and these returns should be aligned with SOL's value. This alignment would tightly bind network prosperity to SOL's value capture. For these reasons, we propose revising the priority fee distribution to (The specific ratio can be further discussed.): * 70% to validators, * 20% burned, * 10% reverted to the treasury. This adjustment will enable the treasury to benefit from ecological growth, creating a positive ""recovery-expenditure-recovery"" cycle. It will also enhance SOL's value capture from the ecosystem and, when combined with the treasury's regular incentives, accelerate burns and value capture â€“ ultimately helping achieve the 2% terminal inflation rate target. # 4. The Necessity and Strategic Significance of Solana's Official Applications The launch of official applications by public chains will become an inevitable trend, driven by three key factors: # â‘  Public chains need to control core applications Core applications play a crucial role in empowering the public chain's token and ensuring ecological stability. If core applications encounter issues, they can disrupt the development of other ecological projects. Thus, managing these applications in-house (by the public chain team) is optimal. For example, Aerodrome â€“ the DEX on Base â€“ was co-launched by the Base team and Velodrome, an established DeFi team. Revenue from Aerodrome can be reinvested to support the Base team's operations. Even if Aerodrome faces issues, the public chain team can provide backup support. In contrast, third-party teams may struggle to recover from hacks or even execute rug pulls â€“ resulting in significant ecological losses. Examples of such core applications include DEXs, over-collateralized stablecoin projects, and Curve-like protocols. These are all suitable for Solana to develop as official, native applications. # â‘¡ Public chains need to ensure core applications empower the native token (which is $SOL, not third-party tokens) Ecological applications on public chains employ diverse business models and tokenomic mechanisms.

Note: The strategic insights presented in this article reflect the author's current views. If given the opportunity to communicate in depth and gain a better understanding of Solana's future plans, the author is capable of developing more aligned strategies, facilitating their implementation, and validating the author's vision for Web3 development. # AfterWord Recently, the BNBChain ecosystem has seen a surge in momentum, and ecosystem activity has experienced a resurgence. While many may view this recent upswing of BNB as merely a short-lived boom, the actual situation is that the industry will develop along two paths: 1. The first path involves the continuous emergence of new hot topics that drive market sentiment, leading to numerous pump-and-dump activities. However, this path will undoubtedly present opportunities for substantial gains, attracting capital, users, and development teams to explore more efficient products and tools around it. 2. The second path focuses on more fundamental inherent needs that better drive industry development, such as directions like RWA (Real-World Assets), AI (Artificial Intelligence), and DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). For public chains, DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), and CEXs (Centralized Exchanges), the optimal approach is to actively embrace both paths. Therefore, Solana can, to a certain extent, draw lessons from BNBChainâ€™s experience in the first path while exploring the second path based on its own unique advantages. This article represents some reflections on the second path. Of course, the strategy mentioned in this article is only the first step; once this first step is truly taken, there will be a second-phase strategy. I hope to have the opportunity to share more about it in the future. # Answers to Some Questions **Q: Is this approach too centralized?** A: For a public chain, technology can be decentralized, but operationally, a central guiding force is needed to steer its development. Otherwise, it may well be eliminated in the fierce competition. Therefore, a certain degree of centralized operation is acceptable. **Q: Regarding the revised data mentioned in the article, are there more appropriate data points available?** A: The data is definitely not final and requires further discussion, but the overall operational logic is relatively certain. The development pattern of the industry will most likely make public chains, DEXs, and CEXs competitors to one another. Hence, it is necessary to make preparations and plans early. **Q: The article mentions many applications, such as stablecoin protocols, for which there are already existing projects. Why is there still a need for the official team to develop one?** A: SOL-based stablecoin protocols will be among the most important DeFi financial infrastructures and are closely tied to SOL. They need to be overseen by the official team. Because if it were a third-party protocol, the development of that protocol would be aimed at its own growth and would not prioritize the impact on SOL. In contrast, if developed by the official team, the economic flows within it can drive capital repurchases and redistribution for SOL.",2025-10-23 01:57:00,Glittering-Parsley38,post,solana,,Reddit,1
p_1odp4ym,"Solana 2-4 Year Price Forecast: Deep Research Request for Technical Upgrades and Ecosystem Growth # Solana 2-4 Year Price Forecast: Deep Research Request for Technical Upgrades and Ecosystem Growth **TL;DR** Solana is reinforcing its technological advantage through revolutionary upgrades scheduled for 2025-2026, including **Alpenglow** (150ms finality), **Firedancer** (1M+ TPS), and **BAM** (MEV optimization)^(1). The ecosystem is rapidly expanding, with current TVL at $12.8B (+30% QoQ), over 22M monthly active addresses (compared to Ethereum's 10M), and developer growth of +29% YoY^(2). While Solana holds an advantage over competitors in speed (3,700 TPS vs Ethereum's 30 TPS), adoption rate (2.44M DAU vs Ethereum's 725K), and pace of innovation (2-3 times faster) ^(3), a maturity gap persists, with its TVL market share at 8% compared to Ethereum's 59%^(4). Although data correlating technology and price is limited^(55), the 2027-2029 outlook suggests: * A **conservative target** of **$400â€“$600** if the upgrades are successful^(6666). * A **bullish possibility** of **$800â€“$1,200** with the influx of institutional capital and the mainstream adoption of DeFi/RWA (Real World Assets)^(7777). Technical Upgrade Performance Analysis ^(8) 1. Alpenglow Consensus Upgrade (SIMD-0326) ^(9) * **Overview:** Alpenglow is the most ambitious core protocol overhaul in Solana's history, introducing a new architecture to replace Proof-of-History (PoH) and TowerBFT^(10). It passed governance in September 2025 with 98.94% validator approval^(11). * **Key Technical Specifications:** * **Votor (Voting & Finality Engine):** Removes on-chain vote transactions (currently millions daily) via off-chain voting with BLS signature aggregation^(12). Achieves **100x faster deterministic finality** (median \~150ms) compared to the current 12.8 seconds^(13). * **Rotor (Data Propagation Layer):** Improves Turbine with stake-weighted single relay, showing 20-30% bandwidth efficiency in simulations, alleviating leader bottlenecks and enabling faster recovery post-downtime^(14). * **Resilience Model (""20+20""):** Maintains liveness and safety while allowing for 20% malicious stake and 20% offline (max 40% total outage)^(15). * **Release Schedule:** * **Testnet:** Public deployment expected December 2025^(16). * **Mainnet:** Activation expected Q4 2025 end \~ Q1 2026 beginning^(17). * **Expected Network Impact:** 100x finality reduction supports real-time applications (HFT, instant multiplayer games)^(18). Potential for 1M TPS with SIMD-0370^(19). Eases the barrier to entry for smaller operators, enhancing decentralization^(20). * **Technical Challenges:** Byzantine tolerance drops to 20% (vs TowerBFT's 33%)^(21). Implementation risk is high due to a major rewrite and the ""AlpenSwitch"" toggle planned for the testnet^(22). 2. Firedancer Validator Client ^(23) * **Overview:** Developed by Jump Crypto, Firedancer is an independent, high-performance validator client aimed at enhancing Solana's scalability, reliability, and decentralization^(24). * **Deployment Schedule:** * **Hybrid (Frankendancer):** Limited operation on mainnet since September 2024, expanding to \~10% of validators by Q1 2025^(25252525). * **Independent Firedancer:** Rollout Q2-Q3 2025, with some sources pointing to late 2025 or early 2026 to align with Alpenglow^(26). * **Performance Benchmarks:** * **TPS Improvement:** 1M+ TPS in lab tests (222x current \~4,500 TPS)^(27). Sustained 46,000+ TPS on devnet under load^(28). * **Latency Reduction:** 20-40ms block time (vs current \~400ms)^(29). * **Expected Network Impact:** Unlocks block limits with SIMD-0370 dynamic scaling, targeting 1M TPS^(30). Reduces outage risk due to client diversity^(31). 3. Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM) ^(32) * **Overview:** Jito's BAM introduces a decentralized, programmable transaction scheduling and block building layer to Solana, shifting from the traditional validator-led model to a distributed marketplace^(33). * **Implementation Status (October 2025):** Fully launched on mainnet since September 25, 2025^(34). Transitioned from Jito's proprietary Block Engine to this open-source framework^(35). * **Actual MEV Impact:** BAM significantly mitigates negative MEV (e.g., frontrunning, sandwich attacks) on Solana by privatizing order execution in TEE hardware^(36). Qualitatively, this is a ""fundamental change"" in microstructure^(37). * **Adoption Metrics:** Over 100 validators have integrated BAM, with 97.8% of Solana's stake already using the Jito client, facilitating adoption^(38). **Ecosystem Growth Metrics** * **Developer Activity Metrics (October 2025):** Total Monthly Active Developers (MAD) are 3,860, with full-time developers growing +29% YoY^(39). Solana showed the fastest growth (+83% YoY) among large ecosystems in 2024^(40). Retention rate has stabilized at \~57%^(41). * **DApp Ecosystem Size & Growth:** Grew from 1,360 DApps in Q1 2024 to 2,100 in Q1 2025 (54% YoY)^(42). * **User Base Statistics (October 2025):** Daily Active Wallets (DAW) are 2.08M^(43). Monthly Active Addresses (MAA) are 38.4M (92% YoY increase)^(44). Solana is the leader among public L1s^(45). * **DeFi Protocol Growth (October 2025):** TVL is $12.76B (Q2 QoQ +30.4%)^(46). **Competitive Analysis** **^(47)** || || |**L1 Blockchain**|**Real-World TPS**|**Current Finality**|**-MAD 2025**|**TVL (Oct 2025)**|**Market Share**|**DAU/DAA**| |**Solana**|1,000-3,700|12.8s|1,161|$12.8B|7-8%|2.44M| |**Ethereum**|15-30|12-15 min|3,241|$95B|55-59%|600-725K| * **Competitive Edge:** Solana maintains a clear lead in speed (3,700 TPS vs Ethereum 30 TPS) and user adoption (2.44M DAU vs 725K)^(484848). The planned 150ms finality (Alpenglow) is set to surpass Avalanche's 2 seconds^(49). * **Disadvantages:** A significant gap in TVL/Maturity (8% share vs Ethereum 59%) remains^(50). Concerns exist regarding centralization risk due to high hardware requirements and past outages^(51). 2-4 Year Price Forecast (2027-2029) ^(52) || || |**Scenario**|**Probability**|**2027 Price**|**2029 Price**|**Key Catalysts**| |**Conservative**|30%|$400-$450|$500-$600|Gradual adoption, partial regulation ^(53)| |**Base**|50%|$550-$650|$700-$800|Successful upgrades, ETF approval ^(54)| |**Optimistic**|20%|$700-$900|$1,000-$1,200|Mainstream breakthrough, RWA explosion ^(55)| **Weighted Average Target:** * **2027:** **$575** (Range $500â€“$700) ^(56) * **2029:** **$760** (Range $600â€“$950) ^(57) **Key Assumptions:** The forecast is contingent on a 40% success rate in technical execution (Alpenglow/Firedancer), 30% market adoption (TVL/developer/user growth), and 30% external factors (Bitcoin cycle, regulation, competition)^(58). **Risks and Mitigation** || || |**Downside Risks**|**Mitigation Factors**| |Technical execution failure (delays, bugs, outages) ^(61)|Multi-client diversity (Firedancer) reduces single points of failure ^(62)| |Regulatory hostility (SEC security classification, ETF rejection) ^(63)|Robust developer community (+29% YoY) sustains innovation ^(64)| |Competition (Sui/Aptos technical leaps, Ethereum L2 expansion) ^(65)|Institutional interest (VanEck ETF application) signals legitimacy ^(66)| **Conclusion:** Solana is entering an unprecedented technical upgrade cycle (Alpenglow, Firedancer, BAM)^(67). While current metrics show strong momentum (22M MAA, +29% YoY developer growth) ^(68), the 2-4 year outlook is ""high-risk, high-reward""^(69). Successful execution of the technical road map is balanced against regulatory uncertainty and market volatility^(70). Investors should monitor the progress of the Alpenglow testnet (December 2025) and mainnet (Q1 2026), as well as ETF regulatory developments^(71). I've previously researched this using AI, and I'd like to share it with you. I'm not sure what tariffs have to do with Solana, or any blockchain for that matter. Solana, which is generating high revenue year-over-year and doubling in growth, is currently significantly undervalued. Solana is not a risky asset. Solana holds the second-largest DeFi TVL at $11.06B and boasts a DEX daily trading volume of $6.16B, overwhelming all other chains. It boasts unparalleled developers and protocols like Jupiter, Raydium, Sanctum, Backpack, and Helius. It also boasts a diverse portfolio of 2.4 million daily active users, ranking among the top Layer 1s and handling a high daily throughput of 77.9 million transactions. Furthermore, its staking rate is as high as 67%. Once you start using the Solana ecosystem, you'll likely find yourself avoiding other layers due to the convenience it offers. While it's true that reliability is an issue due to a history of downtime, many developers have researched and worked hard to minimize the issues, and we're now seeing Solana handle extremely high traffic levels much better than before. Furthermore, we're currently working to upgrade to Alpenglow, ensuring even greater speed, stability, and security. More importantly, not only Solana, but all on-chain protocols are unrelated to tariffs. Everything that happens on the blockchain has absolutely nothing to do with tariffs. Why should the price drop so absurdly due to tariff news? Are Ethereum or Solana truly risky products? I simply don't understand. I know all too well how much effort and time has gone into creating this ecosystem. It's truly heartbreaking.",2025-10-23 01:23:00,Proud_Inflation6761,post,solana,,Reddit,1
